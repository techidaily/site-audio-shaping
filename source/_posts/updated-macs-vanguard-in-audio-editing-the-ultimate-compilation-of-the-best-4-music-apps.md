#### 9. Online Sequencer

**Price:** Free ![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-online-Sequencer.jpg)

This is a perfect tool for developing an idea for a song, as you can create a sequence in just a few minutes. You can choose from Piano, Drums and Guitar categories of instruments or browse through a huge collection of fully customizable preset sequences that is updated on a daily basis. The platform also lets you import MIDI files and work on projects you’ve already started developing or you can export your sequences as MIDI files from the Online Sequencer and edit them with your DAW. Even though Online Sequencer is a useful tool for making music, the features it offers can’t really be compared with those on Soundation or AudioSauna.

#### 10. Autochords

**Price:** Free ![Online Music Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/online-music-maker-Autochords.jpg)

Finding new ideas for songs is often more difficult than it sounds, and if you ever face a creative block you should simply head over to Autochords. This platform suggests chord progressions based on the parameters you set, so you just have to select an instrument and the name of the song to set the feel, and the platform will show you the main progression and its alternatives. Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
