The recordings of important business meetings or stunning moments from the events you attended contain both sound and video. Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free.

So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online destinations where you can find a huge number of different glitch effects you can use in all of your projects for free.

## The Best Online Destinations Where You Can Download Glitch Sound Effects for Free

There are so many different types of glitches you can add to your videos, and each of them creates a different impression when paired with a different sound. Experimenting with sounds until you find the one that fits the visuals perfectly is probably the best way to make a glitch effect more realistic. Let’s take a look at some of the best websites that offer free glitch sound effects.

#### 1. [ZapSplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/sound-effect-category/glitches/)

![ZapSplat online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/zapsplat-glitches-sound-effect-category.jpg)

ZapSplat is currently one of the largest online sound libraries that offers huge selections of royalty-free music and sound effects. The sound effects are organized by categories so you can browse through Explosion, Industrial or Nature categories while searching for effects you want to use in your video. The Glitches category contains a huge selection of different glitch sound effects that can be downloaded in either mp3 or wav formats. However, you must first create an account and become a Gold member of the ZapSplat community in order to be able to download these effects.

#### 2. [Storyblocks](https://www.audioblocks.com/royalty-free-audio/computer+glitch+sound+effect)

![storyblocks online glitch sound effect download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyblocks-glitch-sound-effect.jpg)

Besides audio files, you can also find stock photos and videos on this platform, but before you can start downloading files you must first create an account. Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)

You can search for individual glitches by browsing through tags or you can browse through packs that can contain thirty or more glitch sound effect. Keep in mind that you are not going to be able to download a pack or an individual sound effect until you create an account on this platform.

#### 4. [Sounddogs](https://www.sounddogs.com/)
