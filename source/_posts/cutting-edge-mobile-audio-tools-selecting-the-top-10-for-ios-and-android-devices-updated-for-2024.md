 In case you were looking for a quick way to mute or remove the audio in your videos, you came to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can mute audio in Windows Movie Maker or add new audio files to videos. We're also going to provide you with an alternative solution that lets you have more control over the audio editing process.

## Part 1: How to Mute Audio in Windows Movie Maker?

 Muting the audio in a video clip is simple, regardless of the video editing software you're using. Windows Movie Maker lets you mute audio in just a few steps, so let's see how you can mute videos with this video editor.

**Step 1:** In order to start editing a video, you must first import it into Windows Movie Maker. Click on the **Add Videos and Photos** icon in the software's **Home tab** and proceed to select the clip you'd like to mute.

![ Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-interface.jpg)

 Click on the **Open** button in the Add Videos and Photos window and your clip will be imported into the software.

**Step 2:** After you added a clip to the storyboard you can preview it in order to decide which parts of the video you'd like to mute. Click on the **Edit** menu in the software's ribbon, to gain access to the video editing tools Windows Movie Maker has to offer.

 If you would like to mute only a portion of a video clip, you should position the playhead on the storyline at the exact location in the video where you want to make the cut and then click on the **Split** button.

**Step 3:** Make sure that the clip you want to mute is selected and click on the **Video Volume icon** on the left side of the Edit tab.

 Recording high-quality videos with Smartphones and consumer-level cameras is easy, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the sound. The camera microphones often record low-quality audio and they pick up background noises that can make the video unwatchable.

 In case you were looking for a quick way to mute or remove the audio in your videos, you came to the right place because in this article we are going to show you how you can mute audio in Windows Movie Maker or add new audio files to videos. We're also going to provide you with an alternative solution that lets you have more control over the audio editing process.

## Part 1: How to Mute Audio in Windows Movie Maker?

 Muting the audio in a video clip is simple, regardless of the video editing software you're using. Windows Movie Maker lets you mute audio in just a few steps, so let's see how you can mute videos with this video editor.

**Step 1:** In order to start editing a video, you must first import it into Windows Movie Maker. Click on the **Add Videos and Photos** icon in the software's **Home tab** and proceed to select the clip you'd like to mute.

![ Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-interface.jpg)

 Click on the **Open** button in the Add Videos and Photos window and your clip will be imported into the software.

**Step 2:** After you added a clip to the storyboard you can preview it in order to decide which parts of the video you'd like to mute. Click on the **Edit** menu in the software's ribbon, to gain access to the video editing tools Windows Movie Maker has to offer.

 If you would like to mute only a portion of a video clip, you should position the playhead on the storyline at the exact location in the video where you want to make the cut and then click on the **Split** button.

**Step 3:** Make sure that the clip you want to mute is selected and click on the **Video Volume icon** on the left side of the Edit tab.

![ Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-windows-movie-maker.jpg)

 Drag the slider all the way to the left to mute the audio. Click the **Play button** in the preview window to make sure that video's sound is muted.

## Part 2: Adding a New Audio Clip to a Video

 Windows Movie Maker also lets you replace the existing audio clip with a new one. Once again, this process is easy and it can be completed in a few steps.

**Step 1:** After you've muted the audio, click on the **Add Music icon,** that is located next to the Add Photos and Videos icon in the Home tab.

![ Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing]( https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-windows-movie-maker.jpg)

 A drop-down menu will appear offering you to select music from an online source or to import an audio file from your computer. Moreover, you can select the starting point of the song you're importing so you don't have to adjust the position of the audio file in your project manually.

 In order to do this, you just have to position the playhead at the desired location and select the **Add music at the current point** option from the drop-down menu. You can change the position of the audio file by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard. Using MP3 or WMA audio file is recommended since other audio file formats may not be compatible with Windows Movie maker.

**Step 2:** The audio file you imported will be automatically added to the video clip on the Storyboard. Click Play in the preview window to check if you like the result. Head over to the **File** menu and click on the **Save Movie** option. Windows Movie Maker will offer you a number of different options and if you'd like to save your video to the computer, you should select the **For Computer** option.

## Mastering Audio Balance: Achieving Consistent Volume Levels with VLC Media Player

## How To Normalize Volume in VLC

How to normalize volume, why should we do it, and what is it after all? – these are the questions when it comes to editing our audio files, as well as the video clips we tend to change the sound of. So, first of all, the volume normalization is pretty much explained as follows: The process when a constant amount of gain is applied to the audio recording, bringing the amplitude to a desirable level, which is “the norm” for the project. If it is a little bit difficult to understand, we have to highlight that when this tool is applied to our volume, the whole recording has the same amount of gain across it, every piece affected the same way. Accordingly, when we normalize volume, the relative dynamics are not changed.

But, why bother at all and why not leave it the way it is? Well, the answer to this is almost the same as on why editing exists in general, right? Things are not perfect! This is the fact that prompts us to make our video clips and audio better, improve it at least on the level which can get us the right amount of viewers and listeners. Everyone have had some pain listening to several podcasts, when the volume was too high or too low, or there were so much background noise that the whole recording was hurting the ears of a person! People will not convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners if their user experience is not favored. So, it is in our best interest to serve their best interest, with a little bit of editing.

When it comes to normalizing audio, there are two reasons we refer to this tool. First is when we feel we need to get the maximum volume, and the second is when we need to match different volumes.

In the first case, you might have somewhat quite voice recording, and would like to make it better without changing its dynamic range, while making it as loud as possible. And when it comes to matching volumes, it is logical that you need to manipulate your editing this way in case you have a group of audio files, each or some of them are at different volumes, so, understandably, if not necessarily, you would like to make them come closer to the same volume.

So, until we give you the step-by step guide on how to normalize your volume in VLC player, we also need to inform you about audio normalization types. Here, generally, we come across three of them: a so-called peak normalization, helping adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording; another is called loudness normalization and it adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness. Last but not least, RMS (Root-Mean-Square), changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.

Using any of this, making it better to listen to your voice, without people being annoyed and their ears becoming exhausting with what you have to offer, you will be making it enjoyable for them and easy to come back to your content, as they will not be obliged to change the volume on their own audio players. Instead, their experience with you will be calm and effortless, which you are aiming to achieve.

So, not, what about VLC? – this is a very popular media player, favorite for a lot of people all around the world, so you should already be quite familiar with what it is, at least by having streamed videos and movies there. Speaking more of what it represents, it is a free-to-use, robust, and feature-packed software that plays a wide range of audio, image, and video files. It is worth noting that it can also play multimedia files directly from extractable devices or the PC and additionally, the program can stream from popular websites such as Disney+, Hulu, Netflix, and so on.

As if it was not enough, you can do simple video and audio editing in VLC Media Player, which a lot of people are unaware of! For example, you can easily trim and cut videos. So, as it happens, we can also normalize volume in VLC Media Player. It is a very handy feature and it works on Windows as well as on Mac. Sooo… How to do that? Because, actually, it is so simple that you might be surprised you didn’t know about this earlier. To learn how to normalize volume in VLC, follow this simple guideline:

First, of course, as every time working with any software, you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your device. Once you have it installed, open VLC. Go to the Tools and Preferences and there, you will need to check the single box which is next to Normalize volume in Effects. Now, set the level to the one that works best for you. Then, when you are happy with the result, you can Save.

This is not something perfect, because it’s so simple to do and actually what it does is just help adjust the general volume, so it leaves the specifics alone.

![help adjust general volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-1.jpg)

But, it might be the case that you are not so satisfied with the simple editing and want a little more to get from the editing process on VLC. So, you can do more with the Audio Effects menu there. And the steps are as follows:

First, on your VLC player, find Tools and then, in the menu, go to Preferences. The window will open, and there you need to select All in Show settings – actually it is a little bit hard to find because this is in the bottom left corner of the window. From there, you will need to navigate to Audio, and then, a little below, click on Filters and highlight it. The checkbox next to the Dynamic range compressor will probably be unchecked – so, check in it.

![find tools and go to preferences](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-2.jpg)

Next, see where Compressor is in the left panel? Select it. And now, you are free to make the changes to the levels as you see fit.

![see compressor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/normalize-volume-vlc-3.jpg)

Here, if you are a little bit overwhelmed with the wide range of options to work on, you can just concentrate the most on Makeup gain, Threshold, and Ratio. The first one is by which you adjust in quiet sequences to raise the volume, the second will help you reduce louder sequences to even things out, and ratio is the maximum level of all audio within a movie, let’s say.

Don’t underestimate Attack time and release time, either. They graduate the changes to ramp them up at first, then down again, rather than initiating them immediately. So, if you set them to your liking as well, this will ensure that you have a more fluid transition in and out of the scene and there are less sudden, sometimes scary volume changes.

Therefore, you are now equipped with the most information you will need to normalize volume in VLC Player – so free to give it a go, play around with the different settings and carry out the best result imaginable for you!
