A pop will incur over the screen, from where you can choose the suitable adjustments. You can opt for managing delay time, decay factor for the audio.

### Step 4 – Preview Actions and Save

The final step is to preview whatever adjustments have been made by you on the audio file. Intently, listen to the audio file. If you are content with the settings, then you can confirm the actions per se. All you have to do is, click on the ‘Ok’ button and the audio is all set to groove your way!

## Bonus: How to add echo effect with [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

## Conclusion

Slaying the audio file in an echo-based filter is all the more soothing. Besides, changing the rhythm of the song redefines the music into a 360-degree angle. According to your requirements, you can opt for a suitable medium. For making use of a good web-based application, TwistedWave is the apt choice for you. Or, you can opt for Audacity software for your Windows PC to add the echo effect on your favorite audio file.
