_With which tool can I add audio in an avi container? Because VDMod, Nandub and Avi-Mux is useless for this process..._

 Sometimes you may want to add audio to AVI but find many programs don't support this. So here I recommend a powerful video editing tool –[Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). With it, you can easily add audio to AVI or other video formats such as MP3, WMA, OGG, or FLAC format and save it as a new file. Now download Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) and learn how to combine audio and video using the simple steps below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1 Add the files to the program

 Install and launch Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor). Then import both the AVI file and audio track to this program. To do this, click the “Import” button or directly drag and drop them to the Media Item. Then select these added files and drop them to the corresponding tracks on the timeline panel below. The video file should be placed on the video track and the audio file on the audio track.

![remove audio from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/video-editor-main-interface.jpg)

#### 2 Adjust the audio file

 If the video and the soundtrack lengths do not match, you may need to edit the audio. For example, if the audio file is longer than your video, move the slider to the end of the audio, and drag it to fit the length of the video. If the video is longer than the music track, you can copy and paste the audio file and place the copied files side by side on the same track.

 If you want to further edit the original audio file, double click it and change the settings of speed, volume, pitch, fade in/out as you like.

 Note: if your AVI file already contains an audio track, you should remove it first. To do this, right click the AVI file and choose “Audio Detach” to separate the original audio from video. Then press “Delete” button on the keyboard to remove it.

![remove audio track from avi](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/audio-detach.jpg)

#### 3 Save the new file

You can also go to the “Device” tab and export with the ready-made preset for your mobile device. Of course, you can also directly upload it to YouTube for sharing with the world or burn to DVD for playing on home TV.

## Audacity

![audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/mp3-mixer-mac-1.jpg)

The first free MP3 music mixer for Mac that we have to consider is Audacity. Audacity is hard to miss because of how easy it is to use. Therefore, many people tend to recommend this software. Audacity is an open-sourced MP3 music mixer that’s entirely free to use. It has a straightforward and interactive user interface that supports the most popular file types, including MP3, WAV, OGG, MIDI, and many more.

With Audacity, you can record right in the app or edit existing files as you miss. It also comes with many effects that you can utilize to improve your MP3 file. Another unique tool on Audacity is the spectrogram that allows you to analyze the audio frequencies. Audacity supports up to 32-bit audio files making it a powerful MP3 music mixer for Mac users.

This MP3 music mixer is ideal for beginners as its features are easy to navigate. However, this doesn’t mean that professional DJs and sound producers cannot also utilize this audio mixer. You can record audio to add to your MP3 using a mixer or a live microphone. It also lets you download digital recordings from social media platforms like YouTube.

In addition, WavePad offers a vast range of effects and supports audio bookmarking, which you would find very useful.

Other features these mixer offers are voice manipulation and text-to-speech functions. It is quite easy to use, making it an excellent option for beginners. Some of the effects people seem to love on this MP3 music mixer is the compression, noise removal, reverb, and many more. There’s also the analysis tool that advanced users can utilize to mix and edit their MP3 files.

With WavePad, speed and pitch changes are entirely possible. It also supports audio scrubbing, which is very handy. However, this file doesn’t support multi-tracking.
