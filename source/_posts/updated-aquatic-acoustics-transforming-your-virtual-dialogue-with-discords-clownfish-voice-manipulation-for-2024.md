### Utilizing YouTube to Transcribe Podcast

One of the easiest ways to create captions for YouTube videos is to utilize the platform’s Transcribe feature. Every time you upload a new podcast to your YouTube channel, you’ll be able to generate captions for that video file automatically.

However, the [voice to text technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) the platform is using doesn’t always create accurate transcriptions, which is the reason why you must go through the entire transcription and make sure that the text matches its source.

Moreover, YouTube recently made the automatic captioning feature available during live streams, which enables you to generate transcriptions of your podcasts even while the recording session is in progress.

**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work. Transcribing each episode of the podcast you are running can help you improve your SEO strategy and draw more attention to your work.

Temi’s proprietary algorithm was created by speech recognition experts and it can easily detect multiple speakers. Furthermore, the platform lets you add timestamps wherever you want and it grants you access to the tools you can use to polish the automatically generated transcripts. You can download all the transcriptions you create with Temi to your computer and choose if you want to save them as Word, PDF or SRT files.

**Pros**

* The straightforward audio transcription process
* Excellent speaker identification features
* No subscriptions required
* Inexpensive audio transcription option

**Cons**

* The quality of the transcription depends on the quality of the audio file
* Transcription of long audio recordings can take a while

### 9\. [Castos](https://castos.com/)

**Price:** Pay as you go, $0,10 per minute

Castos is a podcast hosting platform that is equipped with a powerful voice to text technology which transcribes all episodes of your podcasts accurately. This tool improves the visibility and the reach of the content you upload to your account on Castos, and makes it easier for you to optimize it for search engines. So, in order to start using this option, you will have to activate it from the Integrations section on the dashboard. Once you enabled the platform’s transcription features, all new episodes you upload to Castos are going to be transcribed automatically. What’s more, you will also be able to transcribe episodes you uploaded before activating this feature.

**Pros**

* Automatic transcription process
* Castos lets its users transcribe all podcast episodes regardless of when they were uploaded
* Compatible with YouTube Republishing feature
* Generates PDF transcription files listeners can download

### 10\. [Descript](https://www.descript.com/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $10 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based, macOS, Windows

In case you are looking for software you can use to record, edit and transcribe your podcasts, then you shouldn’t look much further than Descript. This cross-platform tool can be used to edit both audio and video files, while the Lyrebird AI enables you to correct any mistakes by simply typing what you really want to say. Descript automatically transcribes your videos with 96% accuracy and it detects multiple speakers effortlessly. It takes only three minutes to transcribe an hour-long podcast, but the software also allows you to use the human transcription services, although you will have to pay $1,25 for each minute of the transcription.

**Pros**

* Available on both Mac and PC computers
* Equipped with the Lyrebird AI
* Offers both audio and video editing tools
* Quick transcription turnaround

**Cons**

* No file sharing options
* The free version of Descript doesn’t offer transcription services

## How to Make the Process of Transcribing Podcasts Quicker for Free

You don’t have to spend money on subscriptions to voice-to-text software products every month since Google Docs offers a simple and free solution. You can enable the Voice Typing feature from the Tools menu and then just proceed to record your podcasts.

This tool will transcribe everything you say, although its accuracy depends on the quality of the audio recording. In addition, the Voice Typing feature can be used to transcribe the podcasts you already recorded, but you have to repeat exactly what is being said in the episode you are transcribing.

You shouldn’t expect a high level of accuracy, since the Voice Typing tool is still being improved, and you should keep in mind that proofreading a transcript can help you eliminate all mistakes that occurred during the automatic transcription process.

### Utilizing YouTube to Transcribe Podcast

One of the easiest ways to create captions for YouTube videos is to utilize the platform’s Transcribe feature. Every time you upload a new podcast to your YouTube channel, you’ll be able to generate captions for that video file automatically.

However, the [voice to text technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) the platform is using doesn’t always create accurate transcriptions, which is the reason why you must go through the entire transcription and make sure that the text matches its source.

Moreover, YouTube recently made the automatic captioning feature available during live streams, which enables you to generate transcriptions of your podcasts even while the recording session is in progress.

**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work. Transcribing each episode of the podcast you are running can help you improve your SEO strategy and draw more attention to your work. Which podcasting audio to text transcription software are you using to transcribe audio and video files? Leave a comment and let us know.
