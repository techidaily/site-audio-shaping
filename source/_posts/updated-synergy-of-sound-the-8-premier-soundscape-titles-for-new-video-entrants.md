### #2) Put Music over Video with iMovie

![music over imovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/music-over.png)

Just as you can probably guess by its name, iMovie is a video editor made by Apple which is available on almost all of its devices. This means that you can have a similar editing experience on your iPhone, iPad, iMac, and more. While this software is not ideal for any kind of advanced and large scale video editing projects, it is certainly more than enough for adding music to video files. Despite lacking video effects or other advanced features, you do get basic options like trimming, cutting, cropping, adding music, adding text, and other basic yet important features. Hence, if you want to learn how can I put music over a video on any of your Apple devices for completely free, then you can go through these steps and instructions:

● Since iMovie is available for both mobile devices and computers, we will be first taking a look at adding music on mobile devices and then on computers.

● On your Apple mobile device, you need to press the Add Media button on the iMovie timeline where you need to select Audio and browse from the display list.

● You can then tap on the Add icon next to the music track that you want to add to your videos.

● Finally, move the music track under your video and trip it to your desired length before saving your video in a desired video format along with the music track under it.

### 3\. Save the video
