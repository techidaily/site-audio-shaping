![load 3xosc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).

![vol subtab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant

### 2\. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself

If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.

**Step 1:** First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1\. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 & Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.

![load 3xosc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).

![vol subtab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant

![tns button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.
