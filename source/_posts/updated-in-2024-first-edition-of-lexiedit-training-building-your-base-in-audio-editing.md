Everything needs to be done from scratch, that too, at the SFZ file level itself. In a nutshell, you must be a skilled and highly experienced composer to operate Plogue Sforzando.

However, being one of the standalone and **free VST plugins**, Sound Delay can only be used to delay audio signals. Apart from this, it doesn’t provide any functionality whatsoever.

**Features:**

* Delay Audio Signals in milliseconds or using samples
* Delay mid & side-channels separately

However, if you’re an experienced music composer, Tube Amplifier will fit your studio perfectly. As we mentioned earlier, it can be used to apply asymmetric tube triode overdrive, which is usually found in single-tube microphone preamp boxes. It also contains a low-pass filter that’ll help you imitate a low-quality tube-triode.

**Features:**

* Asymmetric tube triode overdrive
* Two processing modes
* Additional output saturation stage
* Stereo and multi-channel processing
