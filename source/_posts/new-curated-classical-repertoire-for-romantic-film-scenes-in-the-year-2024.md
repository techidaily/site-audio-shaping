Volume boosters are safe, especially for the **sound booster** apps mentioned above. These apps use advanced technology to boost the loudness of your smartphone by sacrificing clarity without damaging your phone. However, using these booster apps for short periods of time is recommended since they are built with limits for boosting volume.

It is not only useful to split large MP3 files into smaller files or to divide entire albums into individual tracks, but also easy to use. You just need to select a start and end time position.

The best thing about Mp3splt is that it doesn’t decode the file during the splitting process, which avoids loss due to digital degeneration. If you need to split an album, you can manually input the split points and the filenames, or you can get them through CDDB or .CUE files. The audio splitter Mac software also supports automatic silence split that can be utilized to adjust split points as well as supporting ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags. It is also available for Windows and Linux users.
