Step6 Click the audio track in the timeline. Among the settings, make changes as you prefer in Pitch, Volume, and Speed. Cut the sections of your voiceover recording you want to remove and add fade-in/fade-out effects. After making all changes, click OK.

![after making changes click ok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/change-audio-track-settings.jpg)

Step8 Add transitions, effects, and titles from the respective tabs on the top toolbar.

![add titles from the title tab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/04/add-titles.jpg)
