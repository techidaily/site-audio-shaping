![adjust part of audio amplification audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-part-of-audio-amplification-audacity.jpg)

## Part 4: What's the Difference between Normalize and Amplify?

Amplify and Normalize are two essential features of the Audacity tool. Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.

### **Amplify**

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

![audacity normalize interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-normalize-interface.jpg)

**Related**: [Best Audio Normalizers for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

Amplify and Normalize are two essential features of the Audacity tool. Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.

### **Amplify**

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

## Part 1: How to Increase or Decrease Volume Without Distortion and Clipping in Audacity

Audio clipping occurs when the audio input becomes too loud for an amplifier to produce, and the surplus signal creates distortion. When editing, you cannot add additional volume to your audio clip forever because this would result in clipping. In this case, you can use the Audacity application to emphasize your material by turning the volume up or down without distortion and clipping on a track or recording.

Learn how **Audacity increase volume without distortion** by following the procedure described below:

**Step 1:** First, download and install the Audacity software on your computer.

**Step 2:** Select the **File** from the menu above and click **Open** to open the audio file.

![open audacity audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audacity-audio-file.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choose the audio track, go to the **Effect** menu and pick the **Amplify** option from the drop-down menu.

![audacity effects amplify adjust audio volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effects-amplify-adjust-audio-volume.jpg)

**Note:** You can increase or decrease the volume by double-clicking the track and using the slider under the **Gain** title.

**Step 4:** Increase or decrease the volume by sliding the slider or typing the amplification value in the text box next to it in the Amplify window as needed.

![increase decrease audio volume audacity amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-decrease-audio-volume-audacity-amplify.jpg)

**Note:** Ensure that the **Allow Clipping** checkbox remains unchecked to avoid clipping. Moreover, keep in mind that increasing the volume to a greater extent can result in distortion.
