## How to uninstall Audacity Ubuntu

For whatever reason, if you wish to remove the Audacity program from your computer, you may follow these instructions.

### Method 1

If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

**$ sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:ubuntuhandbook1/audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.

Thus, PPA-purge enters the scene to help solve the problem. The PPA is disabled, but all of the apps installed by the PPA are also uninstalled, or they are reverted to the original versions given by your distribution.

### 4\. [BandLab](https://www.bandlab.com/)

BandLab is a free browser DAW for Chromebook that you would expect to be a straightforward DAW. Bandlab DAW only works in Chrome, and your phone has a version. While other Digital Audio Workstation manufacturers are starting to incorporate some of the simple cloud functionality, BandLab is a DAW designed in the field.

**Features**

* There are some pretty high-shelf functions, such as tap-tempo, magnetic timeline, lyric editor, and tracking version.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.
