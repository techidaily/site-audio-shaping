**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work.

## How to Make the Process of Transcribing Podcasts Quicker for Free

You don’t have to spend money on subscriptions to voice-to-text software products every month since Google Docs offers a simple and free solution. You can enable the Voice Typing feature from the Tools menu and then just proceed to record your podcasts.

This tool will transcribe everything you say, although its accuracy depends on the quality of the audio recording. In addition, the Voice Typing feature can be used to transcribe the podcasts you already recorded, but you have to repeat exactly what is being said in the episode you are transcribing.

You shouldn’t expect a high level of accuracy, since the Voice Typing tool is still being improved, and you should keep in mind that proofreading a transcript can help you eliminate all mistakes that occurred during the automatic transcription process.

### Utilizing YouTube to Transcribe Podcast

One of the easiest ways to create captions for YouTube videos is to utilize the platform’s Transcribe feature. Every time you upload a new podcast to your YouTube channel, you’ll be able to generate captions for that video file automatically.

However, the [voice to text technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) the platform is using doesn’t always create accurate transcriptions, which is the reason why you must go through the entire transcription and make sure that the text matches its source.

Moreover, YouTube recently made the automatic captioning feature available during live streams, which enables you to generate transcriptions of your podcasts even while the recording session is in progress.

**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work. Transcribing each episode of the podcast you are running can help you improve your SEO strategy and draw more attention to your work.

## Part 3\. Tips To Optimize Zoom Audio Settings for Better Performance

Although Zoom meeting is itself an amazing app with so many different features, among those features, one is that Zoom has high-quality video and audio. Besides everything, you can still improve Zoom Audio's performance by following the tips that are shared below.

### · Reduce Background Noise

Your audio performance is instantly improved if you reduce background noise. Any disturbing noise in the background falls under this category. It can be the fan, air conditioning, ticking clocks, etc. You should move away from the noise.

### · Use High-Quality Microphone

For better audio performance, use a high-quality microphone for your Zoom meetings. This factor is the most important factor when it comes to improving audio. Investing in a decent and good external microphone is never a bad option.

### · Stable Internet Connection

With a weak internet connection, your voice breaks. If you want to have improved Zoom audio performance, then make sure that you have a stable internet connection. Distortion and disturbance cause problems while communicating.

### · Distance from Microphone

You must sit at an average distance from your microphone. Sitting too close will sound like you are shouting. Whereas sitting too far, your voice is quieter, and background noise sounds loud. So, measure the appropriate distance from the microphone.
