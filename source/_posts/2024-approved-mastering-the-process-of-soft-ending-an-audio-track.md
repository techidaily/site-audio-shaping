## Audacity for Podcasts Recording Tutorial

Audacity recording is simple after you've set up all of the settings you need. Make sure to pick just one (Mono) Recording Channel while you're recording with a single microphone.

Each microphone is assigned a separate audio channel if you have numerous microphones connected to an audio interface or mixer. There must be a separate microphone and channel for each participant on your podcast so that you can edit them separately and make sure they all sound well together.

Each of these mono channels will be blended into stereo when you export your podcast later.

There is nothing complicated about the actual recording procedure.

* To begin recording your podcast, press the red Record button.

From the main interface, go to ‘File’ and select the ‘import’ option from the drop-down menu. Then, search for ‘audio’ and then from the file browser, locate the audio file that needs to be edited.

### Step 3 – Do the needful adjustments

A pop will incur over the screen, from where you can choose the suitable adjustments. You can opt for managing delay time, decay factor for the audio.

### Step 4 – Preview Actions and Save

The final step is to preview whatever adjustments have been made by you on the audio file. Intently, listen to the audio file. If you are content with the settings, then you can confirm the actions per se. All you have to do is, click on the ‘Ok’ button and the audio is all set to groove your way!

Slaying the audio file in an echo-based filter is all the more soothing. Besides, changing the rhythm of the song redefines the music into a 360-degree angle. According to your requirements, you can opt for a suitable medium. For making use of a good web-based application, TwistedWave is the apt choice for you. Or, you can opt for Audacity software for your Windows PC to add the echo effect on your favorite audio file.
