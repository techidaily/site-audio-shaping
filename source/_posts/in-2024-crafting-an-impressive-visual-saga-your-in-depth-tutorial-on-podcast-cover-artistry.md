## What is Podcast Cover Art?

In simple terms, Podcast cover art makes a cover design that usually represents the Podcast's host and content. It also includes the brand name and logo. A Podcast cover design must be simple yet appealing to the eyes of listeners. You must always do less and avoid being too overwhelming with the images. Simultaneously, the Podcast cover art must successfully resonate with the ultimate message of the Podcast. It should not be like an alien to your Podcast's content.

Given below are certain elements your Podcast cover design must incorporate.

* You must check for the size of the Podcast cover beforehand. Your Podcast will host on different platforms, which require the cover arts of various sizes. So, what you need to check is the preview of your Podcast cover art on such different scenarios, not to look odd.
* Limit the use of words on Podcast cover design to avoid any confusion in the mind of listeners.
* Avoid using the images that have been in use on other Podcasts or social platforms. You must consider designing a unique artwork to create a brand identity.
* Please avoid using the artwork elements at the bottom, as they are not highly noticeable due to play indicators.
* It would help if you considered designing the Podcast cover art keeping in mind the Dark Mode, especially in Apple Podcasts.

Take note of the specifications and size requirements of the Podcast cover art based upon different platforms such as Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and Google Podcasts, etc. These requirements are available on the official websites of corresponding platforms.
