## The Engineer's Dream Set-Up: Unveiling the Five Cutting-Edge Audio Ducking Programs

# Best 5 Audio Ducking Software You Should Know

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Have you ever been into an event or an emcee session where the background music drops and rises based on the person’s speech or talk? Well, it is the audio ducking action. So, if this concept terms out to be new for you, you are on the right page.

Audio ducking is an off-screen hidden vital phenomenon. It is no more challenging to pick yourself the best **audio ducking software** to do wonders in editing the audios we have brought the best five audio ducking software that you should know of 2020!

![audio ducking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-audio-ducking.jpg)

* [Part 1: What is Audio Ducking?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 5 Audio Ducking Software](#part2)

## What is Audio Ducking?

Do you wish to go live with beautiful background music, interactive sessions, or a fun party time? Many of you would have heard of this [audio ducking mechanism](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as video creators and audio spectators. But, let me introduce it for better understanding.

Audio ducking is a mechanism where the background audio is ducked anytime or compressed temporally if any dual audio is detected or present. Especially in a live session like an emcee, this method helps lower the music when the person starts speaking and rises again when the person finishes. Beyond live sessions, ducking is in narrations, translations, and podcasts as well.

![audio ducking software](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-ducking-software.jpg)

_Source: pro.harman.com_

In technical terms, ducking is a sidechain compression where the secondary audio channel takes control over or compresses another channel. If the control channel threshold exceeds, the audio channel lowers, leaving no trace of background audio, and when the point drops, the background audio levels up again. Such chains or compression is a manual job using signal compressors, portable PAs, and Ui24R.
