# Normalizing Audio in 3 Quick Ways-Audio Normalization

To **normalize audio** is to apply a constant amount of gain to a recording to bring the amplitude to a target or norm. Or simply put, normalizing any audio file with a normalizer software searches the file for a peak volume to set a defined maximum and then brings up the rest of the audio to the same maximum level.

**Audio normalization** is a good practice to get your audio levels right for a better-balanced video, especially imperative for dialogue clips that stand out on YouTube and other platforms. However, out of many different reasons, getting the best audio results from old-fashioned AD/DA converters or matching a group of audios on the same volume levels are still the most common.

Nevertheless, it's not always easy to find an efficient audio normalization tool and – most importantly – to master the process. But no worries because we have you covered. So, dive in to learn some of the best tools and how you can use them to create masterfully balanced soundtracks.

## FAQs about Normalizing Audio

Here we sorted out some frequently asked questions about audio normalization, which can help you learn more about **audio normalization.**

### 1\. What dB should I normalize audio to?

Well, that entirely depends on your audio use, and there is no exact number for normalizing an audio clip. However, for safety, the trick is to stay from the maximum volume level of 0 dB. For overall mix levels, most video editors recommend normalizing audio between -10 dB to -20 dB. Likewise, in the case of a dialogue clip, the recommended audio levels are -12 dB to -15 dB. Still some other suggestions are

* Music: -18 dB to -22 dB
* Soundeffects: -10 dB to -20 dB

### 2\. What is the difference between audio normalization and compression?

**Audio normalization** only and purely changes the volume of a sound by applying a constant amount of gain with a goal to make the loudest peak reach 0 Db. And while normalizing also matches multiple audios to the same volume, it still does not affect the sound dynamics, unlike compression.

On the flip side, audio compression chops off the audio peaks in your recording to get a fuller, louder sound without reaching the clipping limit. In compression, you are changing a proportion of the audio over time in varying amounts.

### 3\. Will the audio normalization process affect the sound quality?

Fortunately, no. **Audio normalization**, when appropriately done with the help of efficient audio editors, never affects the audio quality. When normalizing an audio clip, the digital bit having the highest level below 0 dB is identified, and all the other bits of the audio are amplified to the same level. This translates to no change in the relative difference between every bit, while the noise level also does not change. So, yes, the only thing affected is the output level and not the quality of the track.

#### Summing up

**Audio normalization** is an emerging trend as a good idea to manage high-quality audio levels. This feature can indeed benefit the final steps of mastering music production. However, you need to be careful when deciding where and when to **normalize audio** or avoid it for better results.

So, are you ready to level up your audio game? The above-mentioned audio editing tools are top-notch normalizers that will do the work for you. Also, don't forget to try Wondershare Filmora's distinctive auto normalization feature to produce studio-quality audio.
