### Step 2: Add Denoise Effect

On the right side of the Effects menu, type and search for 'Denoise.' Then, you should select the Denoise option and drag it onto the timeline over the media file. The Denoise feature removes nearly 50% of the noise automatically.

### Step 3: Denoise Effects Control

The rest of the background noise can be customized. For that, head to the ‘Effects Control’ section. You will see Denoise-related options. There, click on ‘Edit’ for Custom Setup. You can adjust both the 'Frequency' and 'Amount' values.

### Step 4: Voice Enhance Effect

Removing background noise damages the quality of voice. This quality can be improved by using 'Vocal Enhance.' You can search it from the search bar in the Effects tab and drag it over to the media file in the timeline. You can also customize this from the ‘Effects Control’ tab.

## Part 3\. Tips and Tricks to Help You Better Editing Audio in Premiere Pro

As we have mentioned earlier, noise removal damages the overall quality of the audio. All your effort goes to waste if your voice is not clear or anything else. Now that you know how you can handle background noise removal, it’s time to talk about something new and different.

The following section of this article is going to share tips and tricks that could be adopted. These will help you to get better and improved quality while editing audio.

### 1\. Restore Bass

The first tip that we are going to introduce is restoring the bass of the media file. You can do this by using the Parametric Equalizer and dragging it onto the timeline. With an equalizer, you can play with different audio frequencies. Whatsoever suits the best, you can set it.

### 2\. Atmosphere Setting

Its essential to first of all create an atmosphere. For this, you can mix sounds, add reverb and even adjust the loudness. An ambiance audio tag can be used for background noise. You need to set the scene for your music or the dialogue.

### 3\. Compress the Audio

To make the audio better and more consistent, it is essential to compress it. Like the name is presenting, compression lowers the volume of loud parts, increases the volume of fairly quiet parts, it compresses the waveform of audio. After compression, your audio sounds instantly better, especially the voices.

### 4\. Dialogue Adjustments

You can unify different recordings for a common loudness if you tag audio clips as Dialogue. If you plan to add a voiceover to your video, then you must improve the clarity, reduce or remove any background noise and also, adjust the reverb. Subtitles could be added to make the conversation understandable in your video.

### 5\. Remove Noise

The noise of the computer fan or the weird hissing noise of the microphone and other similar things are referred to as Background noise. This can become a distracting element. While editing the audio, it matters that you remove the background noise because it does not get automatically removed. So, to have good audio, always remove background noise.

### Bottom Line

If background noise is bothering you, then this problem is resolved. The article above has shared how to remove noise from video in premiere pro. The easy step-by-step guide for removing background noise with Premiere Pro has been shared.

To remove background noise, Premiere Pro is not the only editor. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is another stunning and known video editor.
