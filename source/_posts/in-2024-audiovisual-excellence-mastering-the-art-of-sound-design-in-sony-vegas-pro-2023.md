**Note:**

**Mute:** A blue line is visible on timeline at your selected audio event, simply double click over it for addition of a specific point and then right click for mute adjustments. From appeared drop down menu you can select muted or not muted and the adjustments will be effective on right side of event point.

Or check this video tutorial below:

#### Section 6: Apply unique Audio Effects

If you want to add specific effects to your audio files then use two simple methods on Vegas Pro with its Audio FX tool: One is to add effects on entire video file and second option is to make changes to specific layers of audio project. Use these steps to achieve great results:

**To entire audio layer**

![To entire audio layer ](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-9.jpg)

**To an individual portion of the audio layer**

![To portion](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-10.jpg)

**Step 1:** First of all go to Track Description Box and then press the Track FX icon, an audio track FX will soon appear on your device screen. The three basic controls are always activated, that are Track Compressor, Track EQ and Track Noise Gate.

![Audio track FX ](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-11.jpg)

For additional personalization you need to use plug-in chain button from right corner.

![Audio plugins](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-12.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now select any desired effect from list that can make your audio track more impressive and press Add; once applied then hit OK.

![ Add audio effect](https://images.wondershare.com/edit-audio-in-vegas-pro-13.jpg)

Before you download montage music, you must factor in the following crucial things:

#### 1\. The Storage Space Available on Your Target Device

Unlike documents, montage music takes loads of space. If you plan to download many tracks, you might run out of disk space if your device has limited storage space. For this reason, before you start looking for downloadable montage music, check if you have ample space on your target drive.

If your disk space is almost depleted, you can delete some files that you rarely use or back them up in another drive. You can also uninstall apps or programs that you rarely use but are readily available online. If you are using your mobile device to download montage music, you can expand the memory.

#### 2\. The Safety of Your Device

When looking for free downloadable montage music, you have to factor in the safety of your device. Attacks by cybercriminals are now targeting individuals. Be extra vigilant with the platforms you choose. The site you pick should have a good reputation in dealing with threats.

Before you download montage music, you need to consider the site you are getting them from: Not all sites are equal in quality and legality; some may be more reliable.

Do your research before downloading montage music from any site. Ensure the website is legit to avoid downloading files with malware or viruses.

#### 3\. Internet Connectivity

You'll need a strong internet connection to montage music download. Most people use mobile phone contracts with specific data caps that do not allow venturing outside email or the usual social media connection.

If you download montage music using a phone contract, there's a risk that you might exhaust the allocated data and incur additional charges. You should, therefore, understand when and where to download montage music.

If you've got free Wi-Fi at work, you might want to schedule all the montage music downloads and run them while doing your job. You can also download montage music using free Wi-Fi hubs around establishments like government facilities and hospitals. But, be extra careful with open Wi-Fi, as cybercriminals use this channel to hit targets.

#### 4\. The Copyright Status Of The Montage Music

When downloading montage music, it’s crucial to be aware of its copyright status. Some montage music tracks have copyright law protection, meaning downloading them will be violating the law.

Before you download any montage music online, read the download site's terms and conditions. In turn, this will help you to understand what is allowed and what is not.

#### 5\. The Quality of the Montage Music File

Some montage music files you'll find online are of low quality. And this can affect your audience's listening experience. Before you get any downloadable montage music, check its quality.
