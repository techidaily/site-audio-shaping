We will further discuss Audacity as an audio voice changer, and how to use the software under various conditions will also be discussed in the article.

#### In this article

02 [How to Change Pitch in Audacity?](#part2)

03 [How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?](#part3)

04 [How to Create Robot Voice in Audacity?](#part4)

## Part 1\. How Can You Use Voice Changer in Audacity?

Voice changers are also commonly referred to as voice enhancers, which can completely change and transform your voice. You can pull pranks on friends with voice changers if you are bored.

Some great voice changers include [AV Voice Changer](https://www.audio4fun.com/voice-changer.htm), [MorphVOX Voice Changer](https://screamingbee.com/morphvox-voice-changer), [Voicemod](https://www.voicemod.net/), [Clownfish Voice Changer](https://clownfish-translator.com/voicechanger/), and others. Do you know that these voice changers can be used with Audacity? Let's tell you how.

Step 1: If you are interested in using a voice changer in Audacity, start by downloading your favorite voice changer to your PC. Once done, install it and after successful installation, launch it.

![open voice changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-1.jpg)

## Part 2\. How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a 'Change Pitch' feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.

The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4\. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3\. With Audacity, you also get the 'To' and 'From' controls if you plan to change the pitch manually. To learn more about changing pitch, follow the steps below:

Step 1: For changing pitch in Audacity, start by launching the software. After launching, you can either record the audio or else, from the 'File' section, you can also 'Open’ any file from your device.

![open your audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/change-voice-in-audacity-4.jpg)

Step 2: Audacity lets you change the pitch of a whole file or else for a small portion as well. Now, to change the pitch of a small portion, click and drag the mouse along the recording. Or else, click on the name of the track to select it completely.
