### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

**Compatibility:** Windows

After you add an audio file to the app’s timeline, you should right-click on it and chose the Use Automatic Music Beat Detection option.

Optionally you can also add markers during playback manually by clicking on the Add button or using the A keyboard shortcut. When done you should click on the Apply button in the Automatic Music Beat Detection dialogue box and beat markers are going to be added to the timeline automatically. Nonetheless, you must edit all video clips you want to add to your project manually.

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

### 5\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song. For more studio-problem, please see this article: **[Practical Guide on How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2021](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).**

Splice is also equipped with a huge library of royalty-free music and a built-in voice recorder which enables you to sync your videos to different genres of music or even to your own voice. The free version of the app, however, offers only limited options and you must opt for a monthly or annual subscription model in order to gain access to all of Splice’s features.

### 7.Quik – GoPro Video Editor

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later, Android 5.0 and up

![quik - software to sync video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik.JPG)

There are more than twenty themes to choose from that contain transitions and predesigned graphics you can use to create different types of videos. This cross-platform app syncs all transitions you add between the video clips with the beats of the song you’re using as a soundtrack automatically, which enables you to create dynamic videos. Quick’s audio library contains over a hundred songs you can use for free, and you can also import music from iTunes, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, or Google Drive into the app. Once your videos are synced to the beats of a song you can share them to Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and various other social networks.

### 8\. [Beat Sync Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beat-sync-maker/id1434787464)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 11.0 or later

Roland Corporation has manufactured some of the most iconic instruments in the history of electronic music, so it is no wonder that their Beat Sync Maker is one of the best apps DJs can use to create VJ-ing for their performances. The Auto Beat Sync technology detects beats automatically and syncs them with visual effects. You can choose from five types of visual effects, apply them to the videos you are mixing and adjust their intensity by simply dragging a slider left or right. What’s more, the app features 18 pre-installed video clips you can use for mixing and it also allows you to import video clips that are stored on your iPhone’s or iPad’s camera roll. The maximum duration of a video you can export from the free version of this app is limited to just thirty seconds, and you must make an in-app purchase if you want to create longer videos with Beat Sync Maker.

### 9\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS 11.0 or later](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magisto-video-editor/id486781045), [Android 5.0 and up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magisto&hl=en), web-based

![magisto-upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magisto-upload.jpg)

Video content creators who don’t want to go through the video editing process every time they want to post a new video on social media should consider using Magisto. The app’s AI automatically merges photos or videos and creates the content you can share on social media in just a few minutes. Magisto lets you choose from different editing styles like Memories, Pets or Holidays, and enables you to import footage from the device’s gallery or from Google Photos. The app also grants you access to a huge music library of songs you can use free of charge, but it also allows you to import the music you want to use in a video. Magisto generates videos automatically and syncs the cuts to the beats of the song you selected. The only downside is that you are not going to have any control over how the videos are synced to the beats or make any changes after a video is generated.

**Conclusion**

Sound and music are often overlooked during the video editing process, which often reduces the quality of a video. A simple video editing technique like syncing the cuts with beats of a song can help you create dynamic videos that gather thousands of views, shares, and likes on social media. However, having the right sync video to music beat app is essential if you want to create professional-looking videos. Which app are you going to use to sync videos to the beats of a song?

### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

**Compatibility:** Windows

Cyberlink PowerDirector lets you detect beats and generate markers both automatically and manually, which enables you to choose the method that is best suited for the project you are working on. After you add an audio file to the app’s timeline, you should right-click on it and chose the Use Automatic Music Beat Detection option.

Optionally you can also add markers during playback manually by clicking on the Add button or using the A keyboard shortcut. When done you should click on the Apply button in the Automatic Music Beat Detection dialogue box and beat markers are going to be added to the timeline automatically. Nonetheless, you must edit all video clips you want to add to your project manually.

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

### 5\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song.
