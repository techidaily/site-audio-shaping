## 4.ONLINE AUDIO JOINER

The Online Audio Combiner lets you convert your music file to a desired format and use crossfade between your merged songs. What does joining audio mean?

When you join audio files, you're combining them so multiple files will exist as a single audio file. There are both online audio joining sites and offline audio merging software programs you can use. You can delete those sections you don’t desire and then merge the other clips together to make a continuous file.

### How to Merge Audio Files Online

**STEP 1**

Select an audio file

To put your songs together, you can add two or more files from your PC, Mac, Android or iPhone. It's also possible to upload them from your Dropbox or Google Drive account. Each file can be up to 500 MB for free.

**STEP 2**

Combine MP3 and other audio

If you want, you can add more tracks to merge. Then drag and drop them until you're satisfied with the order. It's possible to convert and crossfade the music file if it's necessary. Take a look at the [how-to guide](https://clideo.com/resources/how-to-merge-audio-files) to understand better how to combine audio files.

**STEP 3**

Save the result

And it's done! Now you can listen to the joined audio to make sure you like it. If it's so, download it to your device or back to cloud storage. Otherwise, just go back to editing.

## "Iconic Public Music Pieces for Sequential Artworks"

The popularity of montages is increasing every day, as they allow you to use fewer words and express more. Adding non-copyrighted music to your montages can help you capture the viewer's attention and communicate your message. We'll give you the definition of copyright and why it is crucial to use royalty-free music in your montage videos. We have given an overview of some of the most popular royalty-free montage music tracks and where you can download them.

## What Is Copyright?

If you are wondering: What is copyright? It's a sort of intellectual property designed to give its owner the entire right of copying and distributing creative work, often for a limited time. Essentially, the creative work could be in a musical, educational, artistic, or literary form.

Copyright protects the creator of the work from unauthorized use or duplication. The original work must be tangible for copyright laws to protect it.

If you're caught using copyrighted material that a legal copyright owner owns, you'll have to pay them civil damages. Infringing upon anyone's intellectual property rights by using their copyright without their permission means you are guilty of copyright infringement.

Claiming you didn't know about the artist's copyrighted material doesn't excuse you from using it in your montage video without their consent.

If you use copyrighted music in your montage video without the artist's consent and profit from it commercially, you may have to pay the owner of the song monetary damages. The court may also ask you to give the artist your profits as restitution.

The maximum statutory damage for the act of copyright piracy can go as high as 150,000 dollars along with court costs and attorney fees. What’s the worst part? You could lose your freedom, as copyright infringement can land you in jail in extreme cases.

For these reasons, you might want to pay attention to copyright issues when creating a montage video. Make sure you use non-copyright music when making your video montage.
