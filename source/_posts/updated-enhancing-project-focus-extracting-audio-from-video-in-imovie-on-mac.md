[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

You can make your own MP3 file of the amazing piece of music for enjoyment on the move, whether it's from a music video, TV show, or concert footage. To separate your audio from your video, follow the steps outlined below.

#### Step 1\. Import your media files into Filmora

To enter the editing mode, run the software and select the 16:9 or 4:3 ratio that best suits your demands. Then select **Import** to import video clips, audio, or photographs from your computer's file folder.

It's worth noting that this tool is highly compatible with a variety of formats, allowing you to edit them frame by frame while maintaining the original quality. Drag and drop videos onto the timeline after they've been imported. All files in the timeline are combined without any gaps by default.

#### Step 2\. Separate the audio and video with a single click

Select "Detach Audio" from the context menu of the video file from which you wish to extract the audio track. You'll see an audio file appearing on the audio track right away. Yes, this is the source video's actual audio file.

You've successfully detached the audio track from the video file.

#### Step 3\. Save the video or audio that has been split

Because the audio and video tracks have been split, you may simply delete the audio or video track you don't need and replace it with the new one. Then press "Export" to save the audio track as an MP3 file, or go straight to the "iPod" preset to listen on the move.

You should first save the split video frame or audio track to a project file on your hard disk if you wish to save it separately in a new file. Reload the project file that contains the video frame after you've finished exporting the audio track, and then export it to a new video file.

## Part 3\. FAQs about Separating Audio from Video in iMovie

To learn more about separating audio from video in iMovie, you can check the FAQs below.

#### 1\. Is it possible to split audio and video in iMovie?

Yes, you certainly can. Select the video clip you want to separate after you've imported it into iMovie. Select "Detach Audio" from the context menu by right-clicking. You can now remove one of the tracks (audio or video), relocate it to a different location in the movie timeline, or alter it.

#### 2\. In iMovie, what does "detach audio" do?

The video clip's audio is deleted, and an audio-only clip (with a green bar) is inserted below the video clip. The audio clip can now be linked to any other clip in your movie, or it can be relocated to the background music section.

#### 3\. How can I remove the original audio (from the camera) and lock the new audio to the video so that I don't have to deal with two different parts (video and audio) when editing?

Make a movie in iMovie that simply mixes all the audio and visuals. You can align the video by listening to it or looking at the waveforms. After it's all lined up, go into the clip inspector and turn off the video track's volume. To maintain as much quality as feasible, SHARE/EXPORT using QuickTime and choose Apple Intermediate Codec as your codec. This will link the secondary audio and video tracks together. Now, into an Event, import the movie you just made in iMovie. You may now combine audio and video editing.

#### 4\. Is it feasible to simply take the video's audio and save it as a sound file?

If you have other clips in the timeline, you can detach the audio and copy and paste it around, but if you want all the audio from a clip or set of clips, put them in a project and make a custom QT export and export "Sound to AIFF file". Drag that into another movie clip or import it as an audio track in iTunes.

#### 5\. How do I get the audio from the clip to detach so that I may remove it and record fresh audio over it?

Only in the project timeline, not in the event pane, can you disconnect audio from a clip.

#### 6\. In iMovie for Mac, how can I mute a video?

Click the **Create New** button in iMovie to start a new project. From the resulting dropdown menu, pick **Movie**. Select the video you wish to mute by clicking the **Import Media** option. Drag and drop the video onto the timeline once it's been imported. Right-click on the video in the timeline and choose **Detach Audio** from the dropdown menu.

The audio and video will be separated or detached as a result of this. Remove the audio from the video that you separated or disconnected in the previous step. The audio file (or layer) is located just beneath the video file on your timeline. Then you can either delete it by right-clicking on it and selecting **Delete** from the dropdown menu, or by simply clicking on it. It will be highlighted in yellow to indicate that it has been selected. And then press the delete key.

#### 7\. How do I view and download a preview?

By clicking the play button next to the **Share** button, you may see a preview of the video. The video can then be downloaded to your computer by selecting **Download Video** from the dropdown menu after hitting the **Publish** button.

Alternatively, you can share it directly from the app to other social media platforms. Apart from removing audio from videos, Animaker also includes other video editing tools that you'll need to modify your videos for social media and your website.

## Wrap Up

As seen in this instructional article, iMovie has countless amazing features as a [video editor on Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Separating audio from a video is one of those interesting features on iMovie.

If a video has music, sounds, or voices that you'd like to separate from the video, following the above-listed steps is an easy way to do just that. One thing to always remember is to keep the app open while exporting.

And if iMovie can’t meet your need, don’t worry. Wondershare Filmora can be your better choice.

## Achieving Precision in Sound Processing: An AI-Driven Approach to Denoising

## How to DeNoise AI

There have often been times when we took some photo or video with our mobile phones or digital cameras, but we found out later that the clip contained hiss, some compression or particles. Everyone, especially in this digital world, is trying to make their content as clean as possible, without impurities, for the audiences to watch, enjoy, and stay with the creators. So, you might find it really uncomfortable when you are in this kind of situation. But what you can do, is doable – you can depend on a video denoise software!

There are a lot of online or offline tools you could use to do that, and we have discussed a lot of them on our web-site, and now, we will review yet another way to achieve your desired result when it comes to noise and grain. So, in today’s article, we will touch upon how to AI DeNoise your image!

The case with this intelligent noise reduction for 2022 is that noise reduction software has been the same for over a decade. This is when DeNoise AI comes to play, because its approach is something new – it uses deep learning. The process is lengthy and focuses on learning millions of images, thus let DeNoise AI to accurately distinguish between real image detail and noise. This is so important because with this new technique, now it is possible to denoise images while actually recovering important detail, something that was impossible a few years ago.

Topaz DeNoise AI has a very simple and intuitive interface with different noise removal options. Anyway, using it in the most effective way would require some knowledge. Oh, and, it would be a headache if you have a slow computer!..

So, as mentioned, traditional noise reduction software most of the time reduces the original detail in the images, but DeNoise AI’s noise reduction eliminates noise, meanwhile, preserves the detail and even enhances it. The new update of Topaz DeNoise AI offers different advanced DeNoise AI Models that can be integrated perfectly into your workflow; you can use it as a standalone piece of software or as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.

## How to AI DeNoise a file

Let’s just suppose you don’t have the software. So, download and install Topaz DeNoise AI. Go to Topaz Labs and select your operating system: Windows or Macintosh OS. Then, install the program.

![download and install topaz denoise ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-1.jpg)

Once the installation is finished, you will be able to see the Topaz DeNoise AI icon among your applications. Topaz DeNoise AI plugins for Lightroom or Photoshop would also be added there automatically, without any further intervention. But, if that is not the case, it’s ok to add them manually.

The first time you open Topaz DeNoise AI, you can either log in with your Topaz Labs account or try the Denoise AI 30-day free trial.

So, let’s discover how to use DeNoise AI in its different versions!

**First, how to remove digital noise with DeNoise AI:** DeNoise AI supports most of the commonly used photography files like raw files, dng, tiff, jpegs, etc. So, open the program, drag or open your image and select the best AI model.

In the upper right corner, you will find a toolbar with these options:

**Preview Options:**

To change the view mode of the photo you’re working with, you can select:

* Original (original photo preview)
* Single (denoised photo preview).
* Split (Original and denoised photo preview with a split slider)
* Side by Side ( Original and denoised photo preview)
* Comparison ( Compare how the different Ai Models work in your photos at the same time).

**Zoom**

Zoom in on your images to accurately check the process’s progress.

![zoom in on images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-2.jpg)

Denoise AI full review and tutorial

On the right side, you’ll find:

* A navigator with the selected zoom box.
* A list with the following DeNoise AI Models:
* Standard: Broadly developed noise reduction that maintains detail.
* Clear: Best for photos with smooth and rounded surfaces such as skin, rocks, water, etc.
* Low light: Best for low-light conditions and heavy noise
* Severe noise: Best for extremely noisy photos
* Raw: The newest AI model in DeNoise. It provides excellent noise reduction, preserving detail, and authentic color starting from a RAW file.
* Main Settings. The Auto mode works great in most situations. However, it can be pretty aggressive and give your photos a washed-out look. With Manual Mode, you can set the adjustments according to your taste.
* The Post-processing sliders help reduce any color noise remaining in your photos and preserve original detail.
* Save Image: To set your output settings before saving your images.

![set output settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-3.jpg)

Then, adjust the setting sliders (you can just select Auto mode here); now, apply the adjustments locally, if necessary, using the mask tool; and, save the file with the output settings selected.

**Second, let’ts move to DeNoise AI workflow.**

If you are trying to find the simplest way to start with DeNoise Ai, it’s better to use the suggested mode, - Light bulb icon! This will automatically select an AI model, and will do so based oon your image. Anyway, in order to remove digital noise there, it’s the best to use the updated comparison view. The reason is obvious – you can take a look right away and compare varied AI models, or the same ones with some different settings to your liking.

![use light bulb icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-4.jpg)

So, how to do just that? Well, select the AI model and fine-tune the adjustment using the following settings:

* Remove Noise: This slider is wonderful!. It removes the noise in your photo, but doesn’t kind of wash out the images. Values between 10-50 are the best in most cases.
* Enhance Sharpness: It sharpens and recovers the detail in images that may become a bit blurry after denoising. It would be excessive if you set the values over 30, in case you would like to avoid odd textures.

After that, you can refine your results with these DeNoise AI Post-processing adjustments:

* Recover Original Detail: It helps recover some detail that has been washed out after the noise reduction and adds a bit of grain to keep the image natural. 20-40 points is more than enough.
* Color Noise Reduction: This is a powerful tool that reduces any color noise remaining in your images. Zoom in on a dark area and adjust the slider until the color noise disappears and you are happy with the result!

**And, the last topic to discuss is DeNoise AI Masking Tool!** The software includes a very simple Mask tool in case you want to denoise the image only in certain areas and not in others. So, the key here is that DeNoise AI will apply your adjustments only to the areas that you paint in red.

You need to ckeck the Overlay tool to see the red color while painting. When you are satisfied with the areas you panted, After painting over these areas, you will see a preview of your mask in black and white. Here, white shows the adjustments while black hides them. Following this, DeNoise AI will just be applied to the areas painted in white.

![check overlay tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-5.jpg)

And, the masking settings are:

* Add/Subtract: to paint in white or black and reveal or hide your adjustments.
* Size: to change the size of your brush.
* Softness: to change the hardness of your brush. Being 0 is the hardest and 100 the softest.
* Opacity: to vary the opacity of the mask to add precise local adjustments.
* Mask options: to clear or invert your mask.
* Overlay: to show in red these areas where you are painting.

Once you finish creating your mask, just click on the “apply mask” button, and there you go!
