**Step 1: Launch the application**

Open or launch the Wondershare Filmora application and choose "**New Project**" or open the existing project from the primary dashboard.

**Step 2: Import the video into the timeline**

Drag the video file to which you need to balance the stream sound.

Another option to bring the video file into the timeline is by executing “File> Import Media> Import Media Files”.

**Step 3: Ducking sound in the video**

Select the clips with dialogue, whereby right-clicking or double-clicking on them, choose the “**Adjust Audio**” option.

On the following audio editing window, tick the "**Lower the volume of other clips**" option to reduce background music or any other media volume.

## Conclusion

I hope you have now come to know why **ducking sound** is a must and how well **Streamlabs OBS** and **Wondershare Filmora** carry out the job. Lastly, with the step-by-step guide to accomplish **audio ducking** with both the software, we can conclude that OBS performance is better, whereas Wondershare Filmora is the best choice in terms of interface and features!
