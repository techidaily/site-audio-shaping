02 [Use Filmora to Add Background Music to Your Video](#Part 2)

## Part 1  Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

### Method 1: Download Using YouTube Downloader

Y2 Mate is an effective working website and gives you the option to convert YouTube videos to mp3\. Y2mate allows you to convert & download videos from YouTube, Facebook, Video, Dailymotion, etc., to Mp3 and MP4 in HD quality. Y2mate supports downloading all video formats such as MP4, M4V, 3GP, MP3, etc. You can easily download thousands of videos from YouTube and other sites. All you have to do is –

**Step 1:** Go to Youtube.com from your web browser.

**Step 2:** Search the type of Applause/Crowd music you require and click on that.

**Step 3:** Copy the link to the video.

**Step 4:** Go to <https://www.y2mate.com/en142>.

![YTB](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/applause-effect-6.JPG)

**Step 5:** Paste the link of the copied YouTube Video and click enter.

**Step 6:** There will be a conversion to the mp3 button for your applause sound effect.

Click “Start” to begin the converting procedure.

**Step 7:** After mp3 conversion, click download, and it will automatically be downloaded and saved to your desktop.

### Method 2: Make an Applause Sound Effect Yourself

You cannot always pick and choose ready-made sound effects from the internet. Sometimes, you need custom sounds specific to the context of your video. Regardless of thousands of options you find on YouTube or sound software. Your applause sound effect might not sync with the visuals in your video. You need to create your sounds and be your foley artist.

Shocking, isn’t it? But, this method is proven to be extremely realistic. Not everybody gives it a thought, but most of the sounds you hear in your favorite movies or TV shows are created artificially. For example, a creaking door sound or a slap on a character's face are created by foley artists using different objects. Similarly, for an applause or crowd sound, gather a group of people, make a proper audience setting, and record them clapping. And that’s when you get your sound effect which is realistic to the extreme.

If you need sound effects for a professional purpose rather than personal use, we recommend using a dedicated audio recorder. The recorder allows you to save the files and edit or omit anything you want. Once you use it, you will notice how it unfolds all the details, even in a simple sound. You can use the original zoom H4N and pack it up with a shotgun microphone.

I guess you have decided which tool you will be using. Here are some things for you to remember –

* Going to lecture halls is a great way of recording clear audience applause sound effects. Normally, people behave well in the lobby and don't scream or yell while clapping.
* If you want crowd applause sound effects with lots of cheering and booing, you should go to a football stadium. Whenever a team scores a goal, one side of the stadium will mourn, but the other will explode with applause and laughter.
* You can try different games to get a variety of sounds. Normally the crowd size and game type determine how the applause sounds will be. So choose accordingly.
* Suppose the video shows a scene of the ocean like the photo above. Then don't just use the sound of waves and get it over with. Layer it with some other subtle sounds like the chirping of birds and breezes. Covering one sound over another is a great way to make the viewer fully immerse into the video.

### Method 3: Use Royalty-Free Websites

Thankfully now we have websites with huge collections of audio snippets and recordings. It will require another article to talk about only the popular free sites. But let's talk about two highly incredible websites. The first one is Freesound. You already guessed what it does from the name. More than 500k sound clips are at your disposal for free.

And the second website is Avosound. Everything is categorized and arranged under a label. So that it is easier for you to find anything you want, you can just log in and use the files for personal use however you like. But remember to give credit to the original artist if you are using it in a video. The only copyright claim that Freesound demands are when you try to sell it to another party.

01 [Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect](#Part 1)

02 [Use Filmora to Add Background Music to Your Video](#Part 2)

## Part 1  Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

### Method 1: Download Using YouTube Downloader

Y2 Mate is an effective working website and gives you the option to convert YouTube videos to mp3\. Y2mate allows you to convert & download videos from YouTube, Facebook, Video, Dailymotion, etc., to Mp3 and MP4 in HD quality. Y2mate supports downloading all video formats such as MP4, M4V, 3GP, MP3, etc. You can easily download thousands of videos from YouTube and other sites. All you have to do is –

**Step 1:** Go to Youtube.com from your web browser.

**Step 2:** Search the type of Applause/Crowd music you require and click on that.

**Step 3:** Copy the link to the video.

**Step 4:** Go to <https://www.y2mate.com/en142>.

![YTB](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/applause-effect-6.JPG)

**Step 5:** Paste the link of the copied YouTube Video and click enter.

**Step 6:** There will be a conversion to the mp3 button for your applause sound effect.

Click “Start” to begin the converting procedure.

**Step 7:** After mp3 conversion, click download, and it will automatically be downloaded and saved to your desktop.

### Method 2: Make an Applause Sound Effect Yourself

You cannot always pick and choose ready-made sound effects from the internet. Sometimes, you need custom sounds specific to the context of your video. Regardless of thousands of options you find on YouTube or sound software. Your applause sound effect might not sync with the visuals in your video. You need to create your sounds and be your foley artist.

Shocking, isn’t it? But, this method is proven to be extremely realistic. Not everybody gives it a thought, but most of the sounds you hear in your favorite movies or TV shows are created artificially. For example, a creaking door sound or a slap on a character's face are created by foley artists using different objects. Similarly, for an applause or crowd sound, gather a group of people, make a proper audience setting, and record them clapping. And that’s when you get your sound effect which is realistic to the extreme.

If you need sound effects for a professional purpose rather than personal use, we recommend using a dedicated audio recorder. The recorder allows you to save the files and edit or omit anything you want. Once you use it, you will notice how it unfolds all the details, even in a simple sound. You can use the original zoom H4N and pack it up with a shotgun microphone.

I guess you have decided which tool you will be using. Here are some things for you to remember –

* Going to lecture halls is a great way of recording clear audience applause sound effects. Normally, people behave well in the lobby and don't scream or yell while clapping.
* If you want crowd applause sound effects with lots of cheering and booing, you should go to a football stadium. Whenever a team scores a goal, one side of the stadium will mourn, but the other will explode with applause and laughter.
* You can try different games to get a variety of sounds. Normally the crowd size and game type determine how the applause sounds will be. So choose accordingly.
* Suppose the video shows a scene of the ocean like the photo above. Then don't just use the sound of waves and get it over with. Layer it with some other subtle sounds like the chirping of birds and breezes. Covering one sound over another is a great way to make the viewer fully immerse into the video.

### Method 3: Use Royalty-Free Websites

Thankfully now we have websites with huge collections of audio snippets and recordings. It will require another article to talk about only the popular free sites. But let's talk about two highly incredible websites. The first one is Freesound. You already guessed what it does from the name. More than 500k sound clips are at your disposal for free.

And the second website is Avosound. Everything is categorized and arranged under a label. So that it is easier for you to find anything you want, you can just log in and use the files for personal use however you like. But remember to give credit to the original artist if you are using it in a video. The only copyright claim that Freesound demands are when you try to sell it to another party.

If you want to download several yet similar sounds,99sounds is your best choice. 99Sounds is a directory that offers royalty-free themed collections of different sounds.

![99sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/applause-effect-1.JPG)

You can check out this small tutorial for downloading sound clips from these websites.

**Step 1:** Go to the website. Log in using your username and accept their terms and conditions.

**Step 2:** You will enter into the big library of sound samples.

Search for your desired one using a keyword like" applause sound effect".

**Step 3:** The results will narrow down to the only relevant ones.

Play them one by one and select the appropriate one.

**Step 4:** Next, go to the import section and send it to your media library.

The applause sound effect mp3 file is downloaded. It's as easy as this.

### Method 4: Outsource Sound Effects

The last method is a paid one. Yes, sometimes we value our time more than money. You might not have the time and patience to create the sound effect you want. The easier way is to get it done by sound artists. There are plenty of SFX experts waiting for you in the marketplace. All you have to do is post the task and the time limit and budget. You will easily find freelancers who offer such services at an affordable price.

The best thing about outsourcing is that you are not confined to a specific location. You can make use of the best talents across the world.
