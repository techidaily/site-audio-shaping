Step 4: Exporting Process

Mark in and out points on your sequence for the session you wish to export. Mute the rest of the tracks. Now, navigate to the 'File,' press 'Export,' and then 'Media.'

### Audio Detaching Process

Step 1: Importing the Media Files

Launch Premiere Pro from your computer. The interface opens up in seconds. The user is recommended to browse the targeted video with attached audio. Add it to the timeline of the Premiere Pro.
