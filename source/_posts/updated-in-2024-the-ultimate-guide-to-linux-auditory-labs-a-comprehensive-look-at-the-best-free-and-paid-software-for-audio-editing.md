How can you find the best transition sound effects? In this article, we’re going to share seven of the best sites where you can download transitional sound effects with no royalty fees or additional costs.

### 1. [Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com/albums/album/1492/) \- SFX Transitions

At Epidemic Sound, they’ve developed an entire audio sampler of transition effects, including “whooshes,” “swishes,” and more. The epidemic is known for their library of SFX and albums, which makes it easy for you to get your hands on what it is that you may need for video production. They’re always expanding their library, as well, so you can find more FX in the future.

### 2. [Sellfy](https://10154417130356796.sellfy.store/p/npgh/)

Sellfy has built a large collection of sound effects that are especially built for Final Cut Pro X. The sampler is 100% free, and it is easy to use if you have a solid idea of how to use Final Cut Pro X.

While there are only a few options on the linked sampler, the site also has several other options that you can choose from, many of them free, and all of them easy to insert into whatever project that you are trying to complete.

The fact is, there are always new sounds being uploaded to the site, and many users are constantly uploading new sound effects and music that can be used in different styles of productions.

You can browse the site and look for what you need, or you can use their search function in order to condense the results as necessary.
