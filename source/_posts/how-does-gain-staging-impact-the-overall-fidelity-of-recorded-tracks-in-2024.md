Even so, Alitu’s automatic audio editing features are not powerful enough to compete with more advanced and more affordable podcast recording software products.

After the recording session is completed you can choose if you want to export the recording as an MP3 audio file or as an HD video file. The lack of basic audio editing tools, effects or plugins makes ecamm Call Recorder for Skype a poor choice for all podcasters who want to polish the podcasts before sharing them with an online audience.
