## "Enhancing Editing Precision with Final Cut Pro: Techniques for Displaying Audio Graphs & Animating Sound Tracks"

The amplitude and duration of an audio waveform vary with the duration and volume of the underlying sound. Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with **audio waveform disappearing**. Or you do want to **add some dynamic effects for audio waves**? Continue reading!

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in FCP?

When working with audio waveforms on the timeline, you can zoom in or out, or change the appearance of the clip to make the waveform taller or shorter.

There are numerous methods to examine and interact with the audio and video contained within clips in Final Cut Pro. You can:

* Expand a clip to see and modify audio elements at the channel level
* Expand a clip to view separate audio and video
* Separate audio from video clip to work with audio and video as separate, independent clips
* Change the appearance of the clipped background to display **reference waveforms** that make it easier to view audio waveforms when the volume is reduced

The reference curve shows the maximum visual resolution possible for the current sound curve. By accounting for changes in volume, the reference waveforms allow you to see the details of the sound more clearly.

1. Choose Final Cut Pro > **Preferences**, then click Edit.
2. Check the **"Show reference waveforms"** box.

When the actual curve changes shape (for example, when it shrinks because the clip's volume level is low), its full reference curve is still visible for easy reference when editing.

![audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-1.png)

**Tips:** You can click the shortcut **“Control+Option+1”** to adjust the clip appearance setting to display clips on the timeline with large audio waveforms only.

## Part 3: FAQs

### 1\. How do I mute a video in an editor?

You may mute a video by uploading it or importing it from a website like YouTube. Make sure your video has audio since turning the volume down won't do anything if it doesn't. Use the context menu to choose Mute after right-clicking on the video clip. The audio on the video clip will delete due to this action, but the audio will remain for that particular clip.

### 2\. How do you edit sound on TikTok?

If you choose the scissors symbol with your finger, you'll see a waveform emerge at the bottom of the screen. You may go to the song segment you wish to hear using your finger. From that location, you can see the song's time stamps. You may also control the volume of the sound by using the option "Volume," located at the very bottom of the screen.

### 3\. How do I repair a video muted on TikTok?

In case TikTok muted your video for any reason, you try these two options:

1. Delete the video, reupload it to TikTok, and then add sound to it while editing it so the video may get played. After that, reduce the sound level until it reaches zero, and you will be able to submit the video. You can include any sound in the video.
2. Ensure you do not reupload the exact video. You can use an external video editing tool like Filmora to add effects and cut the video into shorter clips. Once done, try reuploading the video and follow the TikTok guidelines this time.

Adding a sound to your video and lowering the level of that sound to zero is one way to prevent your video from being removed for violating copyright laws.

## Part 3: FAQs

### 1\. How do I mute a video in an editor?

You may mute a video by uploading it or importing it from a website like YouTube. Make sure your video has audio since turning the volume down won't do anything if it doesn't. Use the context menu to choose Mute after right-clicking on the video clip. The audio on the video clip will delete due to this action, but the audio will remain for that particular clip.

### 2\. How do you edit sound on TikTok?

If you choose the scissors symbol with your finger, you'll see a waveform emerge at the bottom of the screen. You may go to the song segment you wish to hear using your finger. From that location, you can see the song's time stamps. You may also control the volume of the sound by using the option "Volume," located at the very bottom of the screen.

### 3\. How do I repair a video muted on TikTok?

In case TikTok muted your video for any reason, you try these two options:

1. Delete the video, reupload it to TikTok, and then add sound to it while editing it so the video may get played. After that, reduce the sound level until it reaches zero, and you will be able to submit the video. You can include any sound in the video.
2. Ensure you do not reupload the exact video. You can use an external video editing tool like Filmora to add effects and cut the video into shorter clips. Once done, try reuploading the video and follow the TikTok guidelines this time.

Adding a sound to your video and lowering the level of that sound to zero is one way to prevent your video from being removed for violating copyright laws.
