 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

When you’re putting together any video production, the sound effects need to be on point. If not, you’ll find that it’s difficult to draw people in and keep their attention for long periods.

The transitions of your video are sometimes difficult to sort out, and you need appropriate sounds to [keep your audience engaged](https://viewership.com/engaging-videos/).

If you use sound effects well as a part of your transitions between scenes or ideas, you will find that it works very well for what you’re looking to accomplish.

How can you find the best transition sound effects? In this article, we’re going to share seven of the best sites where you can download transitional sound effects with no royalty fees or additional costs.

### 1. [Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com/albums/album/1492/) \- SFX Transitions

At Epidemic Sound, they’ve developed an entire audio sampler of transition effects, including “whooshes,” “swishes,” and more. The epidemic is known for their library of SFX and albums, which makes it easy for you to get your hands on what it is that you may need for video production. They’re always expanding their library, as well, so you can find more FX in the future.
