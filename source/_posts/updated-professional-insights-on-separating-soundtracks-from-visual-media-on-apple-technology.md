### Steps to cut the audio from videos on iPhone

If you want to do the mute on an iPhone, you will need to also follow some steps to get it done on your iMovie.

### Step 1: Open the iMovie

Opening the iMovie app goes beyond just clicking it to open, you also have to follow up this process by clicking the continue button that pops up. If the app has opened and you can see an inviting interface, move to the next step.

### Step 2: Select a video you want

There are different pages on the interface but your concern is on the project page. On that page, click on the plus sign button as it directs you to start or input a new video. After clicking on the plus sign, it will bring up movies that you would further select.
