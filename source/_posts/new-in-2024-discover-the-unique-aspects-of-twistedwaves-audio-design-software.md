* **Instant Listening of Results** – You won’t have to export or download the entire video or audio to listen to the results. Filmora allows you to view and listen to the results in the editor on the go.
* **Removes other Audio Elements** – Aside from extracting acapella and removing vocals, Filmora allows you to extract other elements from your audio. Point out the unwanted elements to remove from your soundtrack to achieve better results.
* **Dub Exceptional Videos** – No need to record vocals in different languages and stick them over the original ones. The AI Vocal Remover feature allows you to completely remove the originals so you can import new and fresh ones. This will give you highly professional and clear dubbed videos in a matter of clicks.
