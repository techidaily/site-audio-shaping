## "Revamping Your Soundtrack? Check Out the Best Audio Normalizers for Windows Users "

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Tap the Sound option at the bottom left portion of the screen once the video uploads to the sound screen. In this section, you will find the option to add a new sound to the video.

##### Step3 Lower Original Sound

From the bottom, go to the tab labeled "Volume." TikTok users may turn off the original audio by lowering the "Original sound" slider to 0\. To silence the video on TikTok, reduce the original sound volume and add sounds until they reach 0 percent.

Lastly, publish the video by clicking the Next button.

## Part 3: FAQs

### 1\. How do I mute a video in an editor?

You may mute a video by uploading it or importing it from a website like YouTube. Make sure your video has audio since turning the volume down won't do anything if it doesn't. Use the context menu to choose Mute after right-clicking on the video clip. The audio on the video clip will delete due to this action, but the audio will remain for that particular clip.

### 2\. How do you edit sound on TikTok?

If you choose the scissors symbol with your finger, you'll see a waveform emerge at the bottom of the screen. You may go to the song segment you wish to hear using your finger. From that location, you can see the song's time stamps. You may also control the volume of the sound by using the option "Volume," located at the very bottom of the screen.

### 3\. How do I repair a video muted on TikTok?

In case TikTok muted your video for any reason, you try these two options:

1. Delete the video, reupload it to TikTok, and then add sound to it while editing it so the video may get played. After that, reduce the sound level until it reaches zero, and you will be able to submit the video. You can include any sound in the video.
2. Ensure you do not reupload the exact video. You can use an external video editing tool like Filmora to add effects and cut the video into shorter clips. Once done, try reuploading the video and follow the TikTok guidelines this time.

Adding a sound to your video and lowering the level of that sound to zero is one way to prevent your video from being removed for violating copyright laws.

## Conclusion

You can instantly alter the level of the music already on the device or any additional sounds by using the built-in Sound function.
