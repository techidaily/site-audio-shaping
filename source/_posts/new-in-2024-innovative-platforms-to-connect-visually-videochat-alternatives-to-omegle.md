### Audio Detaching Process

Similarly, audio separation is another way to access a part of the audio. It permits you to use any audio section and make necessary edits to it. To detach audio in Premiere Pro, kindly follow the guidelines below.

Step 1: Importing the Media Files

Launch Premiere Pro from your computer. The interface opens up in seconds. The user is recommended to browse the targeted video with attached audio. Add it to the timeline of the Premiere Pro.
