## Audacity for Podcasts Recording Tutorial

Audacity recording is simple after you've set up all of the settings you need. Make sure to pick just one (Mono) Recording Channel while you're recording with a single microphone.

Each microphone is assigned a separate audio channel if you have numerous microphones connected to an audio interface or mixer. There must be a separate microphone and channel for each participant on your podcast so that you can edit them separately and make sure they all sound well together.

Each of these mono channels will be blended into stereo when you export your podcast later.

There is nothing complicated about the actual recording procedure.

* To begin recording your podcast, press the red Record button.

![recording-tutorial1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-tutorial1.png)

* When you've finished recording your podcast, press the black Stop button.

![recording-tutorial2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/recording-tutorial2.png)

* Once you've finished recording, use Ctrl+S to save the project. If Audacity crashes or you shut it by mistake, you won't be able to recover your edited audio file.

## Using Audacity to Edit Your Podcast

Audacity for Podcasts not only allows you to record your podcast, but it also allows you to edit it afterward. It is possible to send your raw podcast to the internet as soon as you complete the recording, but editing may add a degree of polish that makes it more pleasurable for the listener.

Some of these editing chores are more difficult than others, but if you just have high-quality equipment & have your settings ideal, the podcast may not need a lot of effort. Check over a few different portions of your podcast to get a sense of how much work has to be done on it before publishing.

In Audacity, you may add music, clips, & sound effects to your podcast intro and outro.
