Starting a conversation with another user is simple. You can start online by just entering your gender, accepting the service terms, and following the steps! To prevent language barriers, you can also use a language filter. A user is never matched up with someone they've already met through a special filter, ensuring each match is different. The ChatHub interfaces are excellent for both video chats and text chats. Since you don't need a profile, you can try without risk.

Additionally, ChatHub is concerned with the safety of its users. Conversations are kept private using peer-to-peer connections. You do not have to enter any personal information on this site.
