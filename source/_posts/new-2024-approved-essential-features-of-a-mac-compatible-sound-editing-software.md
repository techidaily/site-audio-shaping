### Audio Editor: Audacity

This editor handles uncompressed audio and supports many files, including AIFF, .WAV, MP2/3.FLAC and .OGG. You can record from different inputs, employ the JACK Audio feature, monitor the volume, and add several different effects.

The good news is that this editing software is simple, straightforward, and will work for many consumers who create their own broadcasts. However, it is rather limited when recording audio from your computer itself, and you’ll need to add SoundFlower to accomplish that.

### Audio Editor: WavePad

This is one of the more celebrated audio editing software systems for Mac computers. It contains many tools and sound effects and supports a considerable number of file types. The main attribute may be how user-friendly the wavepad sound editor is and the number of different features.

The only substantial negative is that the floating toolbars used will get in the way when you are working on larger projects. However, a big positive is that this editing system can clean up old, hissy audio quite well, substantially improving your recordings.
