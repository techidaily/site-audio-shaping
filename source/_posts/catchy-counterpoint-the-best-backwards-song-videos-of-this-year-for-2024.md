The following 5 videos top our list of the best backwards music videos.

## 5 of the Best Backwards music videos

### [1\. Forward by Messe Kopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6jprOZ29wY)

 This video was created by Messe Kopp and it is a perfect example of how backwards video techniques have evolved over recent years. It uses all the things that you would normally see in a backwards video and it really is a great video as well. You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today's industry.

### [2\. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01TL9bUWr6I)

 Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.

### [3\. Tongue Tied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1x1wjGKHjBI)

 This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.

### [4. Drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQlvSpPuWdo)

 This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.

### [5\. Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vt50B772Fcg)

 This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn't mean that it isn't interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.

 So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn't mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don't you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You'd be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.

**Covert & Export Text into Voice Using Siri**

The above steps will let you convert the text of any web page into voice to make you understand the content easily and quickly without reading it by yourself but you can't export the voices. To export the voice after converting it from text, you have to follow these steps:

**Step 1:** To export the converted voice from text, you have to write the content you want to convert and export as an audio file in 'Text Edit'. Open Text Edit and write the content or paste it.

![siri-voice-generators-mac3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri-voice-generators-mac3.jpg)

**Step 2:** After you have written everything in the Text Edit, select that text and right-click to see the options. From these options, go to the Services and then click on 'Add to iTunes as a spoken Track'.

![siri-voice-generators-mac4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/siri-voice-generators-mac4.jpg)

**Step 3:** Once you click on 'Add to iTunes as a spoken Track', a screen will pop up to select a system voice and place where you want the file to be saved. After selecting your preferred voice and location, click continue. The audio file has been successfully created and saved into your select destination.

The generate voice file can be used for anything you want. It can be used for all your purposes. You can add it to your presentations, videos, tutorials, and more. All these voices that are generated using Siri will sound like a natural and Human-like voice to make videos more engaging and attractive to the viewers. It is not necessary to use Siri just to generate voices that can be used in videos. These voices can be used for multiple objectives. You can use Siri Voice Generator to covert the book into voices and then listen to them while you are walking, driving, or jogging to make the most of your time. It is the best tool that can help you achieve so many objectives very easily and conveniently.

## For Windows

Since Window doesn't have any voice generator like Siri, it is not possible to get your text converted into the voice from your system's built-in features. To convert the text into voice in Windows, it is necessary to use an external service provider. We know that Siri voice generator is the best text-to-voice converter to use while converting your text to audio. But unfortunately, Apple hasn't introduced any website for their Siri Voice Generator. This makes it difficult for the users of the Windows operating system to convert their text into a voice using Siri. But there is no need to be worried, we are here to help you solve this problem. We have found some of the best text-to-voice converter websites that will provide you with the same experience of Siri and its features. There are multiple websites out there that claim to generate the best Siri voices. But it is difficult to choose the best one from all those platforms. We are going to provide you with the best alternative of Siri that can provide you with the same features and qualities as Siri. One of the best alternatives for Siri is Google text to Speech.

[**Google Text-to-Speech**](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)

![google-speech-to-text-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-speech-to-text-poster.png)

**Price:** Chart Attached

**Language Coverage:** 40+

**Voice Choices:** 220+

There is no doubt in the fact that there is no platform or website that can take place of Siri. But Google's Text-to-Speech service is something worth considering as an alternative to Siri. With its service, Google provides its users with a wide variety of language choices to choose from to fulfill the need of every user, no matter where the user lives. The best thing about Google Text-to-Speech is its extensive range of voice choices. You have more than 220 voices to choose from for your content. There is no need to make all your content sound similar. You can always change the voice of your content to match it with the content type and its audience. Google uses the latest technologies to provide you the customized voices for your brand to stand out from the crowd and make your videos and other content unique and different from others. Google incorporates DeepMind's speech synthesis to provide you with the best and most accurate results. The voice generated by Google can't be differentiated because it sounds like a natural and human-like voice. But the thing that makes it less attractive is its pricing. Unlike Siri for Mac, Google charges its user for using its Text-to-voice service on the basis of characters. But all the astounding features and natural voices of Google text-to-speech makes it worth every penny you spend on it. Google has two packages to be availed, Standard and WaveNet. The WaveNet package contains the voices that are used by Google in its products and service such as Google Search, Google Assistance, and Google Translate.

| **PACKAGE**         | **PRICE**                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Standard Voices** | $4.00/1 Million Characters  |
| **WaveNet Voices**  | $16.00/1 Million Characters |

#### Conclusion

Just like Google Text-to-Speech, there various other amazing platforms that provide you with the same services like Siri. You can find the [Top 5 Online Test to Speech Website](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that we will suggest to you as the best alternatives to Siri.
