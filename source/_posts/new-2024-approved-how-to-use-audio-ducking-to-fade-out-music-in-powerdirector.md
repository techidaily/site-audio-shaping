Furthermore, you’ll be able to collaborate with other members of your team through the cloud or share your work via the [Avid Link](https://www.avid.com/products/avid-link) app. The audio recording features ProTools offers can be overwhelming for newcomers to the world of podcasts, so if you don’t have previous audio recording experience it is better to opt for a less demanding podcast recording software.

### 9\. [Ringr](https://www.ringr.com/)

**Price:**  Pricing plans start at $7,99 per month

### 10\. [ecamm Call Recorder for Skype](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)

* Lets its users export recordings as audio and video files
* Great for conducting interviews through Skype
* Requires no previous audio recording experience

**Cons**
