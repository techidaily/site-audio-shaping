## Ideas to Create a Funny Comedy Video or Vlog

Are you a funny person and want to create videos for your YouTube channel? If yes, then here are some ideas that you can try:

### 1\. Create a Comedy Skit

Many popular YouTube content creators create comedy skits to entertain their audience. These videos include humorous content and funny dialogues. To create a comedy skit you should have a center of the story, dialogues, characters, and comedy background music.

The major time that you will spend is gathering the ideas and creating a script. This requires brainstorming and at least one funny guy in your team. For inspiration, you can notice people around you and use them as inspiration.

### 2\. Things You Can Do with Everyday Household Items

Not specifically the eggs, but videos where people use regular items in unusual ways are sometimes funny. These videos will look funny when you include comedy background music. Some ideas of these types of videos are using eggs for various tasks other than cooking.

While creating these videos you can add funny elements like fixing a tile with the egg. These types of content are random, so it makes people laugh. And don’t forget comedy background music plays an essential role to make these videos funny.

### 3\. Visit a Park with Your Dog

Dogs are funny, especially when you take them to the place they like. When you will take your dog to the park and make vlogs about the journey, people will love it. While making vlogs you can record some exciting actions performed by your dog and upload them online. If you are thinking about how these clips will make your audience laugh, then the answer is simple, comedy background music.

### 4\. Make Reaction Videos

Reaction videos that you might have seen might not be funny. But, some content creators make funny reaction videos. They react to funny videos and use comedy background music to make the content engaging.

### 5\. Film a Prank

Prank videos are the most popular comedy videos on YouTube. In these videos, one or more people prank another person while the audience watching the video already knows. Many people who are fond of prank videos love the final reactions. If you want to create prank videos, you can add comedy background music for more fun.
