**Tips**:
1\. The files on Video Timeline will be merged seamlessly together by default.

After that, load the project file again and export the output file one by one.  
2\. You can also use the "Mute" option to remove the audio from the video, but you won't get the audio track with this option.

### 3\. Save the video
