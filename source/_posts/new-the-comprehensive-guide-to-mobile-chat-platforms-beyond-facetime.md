![Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/crash-tag-team-racing-sound.jpg)

### 2. [Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://www.soundsnap.com/taking%5Foff%5Fback%5Fbattery%5Fcap%5Fin%5Fxbox%5Fone%5Fcontroller%5Fwav)

Wireless controllers changed the world as we know it, and in the past, we needed to change the batteries quite frequently.

You could repeat this noise a few times in a row in order to imitate the “pew pew pew” you may hear when someone is shooting in a platform game. Since it’s only a one-second clip, you have a lot of flexibility as to when and how you’re going to be able to use it in your projects.
