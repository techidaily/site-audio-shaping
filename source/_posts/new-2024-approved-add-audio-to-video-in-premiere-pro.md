To change your voice, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** You need to import the audio or recorded voice-over file, or you can even record your voice. Filmora also has the option to change the pitch of the voice. There are four different options for changing the speed of your desired voice.

**Step 2:** After you are finished editing your video or audio, you can save it in multiple videos and MP3 audio format and can also export the file to your computer.

An additional feature of Filmora is that it allows you to upload to social media in high quality and can compress the videos to different Android and iOS devices.
