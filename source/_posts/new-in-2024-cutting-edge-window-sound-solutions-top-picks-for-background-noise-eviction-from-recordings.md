## Cutting Edge Window Sound Solutions: Top Picks for Background Noise Eviction From Recordings

Background noise is the unwanted sound present in the background while recording audio. It diminishes the overall sound quality of the audio or video.

It will make it difficult to hear the recording and concentrate on the topic. Quite annoying, right?
