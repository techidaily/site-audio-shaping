## "Windows Users: Top 10 Essential Audio Leveling Tools "

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."

Although popular among audiobook lovers, Audible has a considerable podcast following too. Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.

Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there's a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.

* **User Review of NPR One Podcast**

"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."

* **User Review of Tune In Podcast**

"I've been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying "features."

1) the screen won't time out when the app is active.

2) the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of "recent" (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.

Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.'

**"**Been using this for years. It does everything I could ever want when listening/ referencing/ re-listening to my favorite podcasts and a lot more.

I've suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something "exclusive"), but I couldn't stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.

Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you're coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app."

The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I'm delighted to have chosen this option.
