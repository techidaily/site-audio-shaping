This is a free download that can be installed in audacity to help you fine-tune your live vocal performance. During vocal pitch correction, it allows audacity to expand its functionality.

## **How Does Auto-tune Works?**

Negative feedback from listeners is a common occurrence for singers. They need to satisfy their audience by giving them their most perfect production numbers. Nevertheless, there are instances when they need the aid of a device to conceal their mistakes or avoid making them. So they lip-sync and autotune their prerecorded songs.

Singers and music producers are not the only ones to use autotune. The most common users are ordinary people who have made music creation a part of their lives. Then how does autotuning operate?

The pitch is raised to the nearest correct tone when a person sings with the key off (out-of-tune). Moreover, the distortion can mask the out-of-tune parts (especially the highest and lowest pitches) in the overall performance.

## **How To Add Autotune To Audacity Using GSnap?**

The autotune effect in audacity is enabled by the GSnap plugin (from GVST). This might be useful for correcting your pitch or creating a robotic voice. You can download it for free and install it on your computer.
