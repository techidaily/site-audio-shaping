The first method of removing vocals in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) is using the built-in vocal remover.

### **Step 1: Open Audacity**

The first thing you need to do is open the Audacity software in preparation for the vocal removal.

![import audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-2.JPG)

### **Step 3: Select Audio Track**

![file import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/quick-and-easy-vocal-removal-in-audacity-a-guide-3.JPG)

### **Step 4: Export as MP3**

Backup the file so that you still have the whole song available for use later. Go to File > Export > Export as MP3\. Audacity will export the track in the original file format. If it was a WAV audio file, the export will be to that type. This ensures that the audio artifacts are kept in the best condition for editing. Be sure to name the exported file in something you will easily remember.
