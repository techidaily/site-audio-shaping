## Part 3 How to edit background music with Filmora

The Filmora applications help you to carry out desired edits on the imported video using its in-built features. To make audio edits, double click on the audio file to make changes on the adjustment sliders that pop up with various options like volume, pitch, fade in and out effects. You can also choose the Denoise option from the popup screen to remove the background noise from the audio clippings.

To customize the audio with advanced settings, then tap Customize option and make manual adjustments. You can manually move the sliders and adjust the values precisely for better results.

There are options to detach the audio signal from the clippings by making a right-click on the media file and selecting Detach Audio option. Add voiceover to the detached audio-video file by using the Record Voiceover feature. This brings great fun and makes your video interactive. You can also trim audio clips and add new tracks as per your requirements. Set the audio speed and duration by right-clicking the audio file.

Use the Audio Equalizer from the popup that opens after a double click on the audio file. Customize the audio track using the in-built settings available with the Equalizer. It includes default, Classic, Low Bass, Sparkle, Pop, soft, and techno. You can also use Audio Mixer and edit the audio signals in two modes like Stereo and surround. The Audio ducking feature in Filmora helps you to lower the background music for a specific duration to enhance the voice of the speaker in the video file. It is used to improve the quality of the audio signal optimally.
