**Step 2:** For adding music to the video(s), simply drag and drop your music over the video track and position it according to the length of the video. One most significant advantage of using Filmora is that it offers you a wide array of royalty-free sounds. To access this feature, you just have to head to the Audio Library in Filmora and drag and drop the music thumbnails you want.

If you want to add extra features to your audio track, you can double click on the track to open the editing panel. Here you can edit the add-on features of the audio like fade in and out, adjust volume, tune the pitch, etc.

### Conclusion

Scream sound effects are one of the most exciting effects that are used in films and shows since years. Though the Wilhelm scream sound effect is the most popular one, the woman screaming sound effect, crowd screaming sound effect, and female scream sound effect are also widely liked, and add to the overall appeal to the video in related scenes. There are multiple sources from where you can get these effects. Using Filmora, you can separate scream mp3 files from movies and shows and then use them by adding them to your own videos. Filmora makes video editing fun, smooth, fast and perfect!
