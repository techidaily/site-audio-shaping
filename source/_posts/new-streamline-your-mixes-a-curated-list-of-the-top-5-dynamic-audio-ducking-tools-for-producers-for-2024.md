Read on to know more about the step-by-step approach how to add audio to video in Adobe Premiere Pro.

02 [How to adjust audio in Premiere Pro](#Part 2)

03 [Adding Audio to Video files](#Part 3)

## Part 1 How to add audio to video in Premiere Pro

Some essential pointers for all would-be videographers are:

● Before you add audio to video in Premiere Pro, be ready to see your file size increase to a large extent. If you add a background score of 15MB, your total video file size will increase by the same amount of 15MB. The best way to take care of such a problem is to use additional compression techniques to get a suitable file size.
