 Click the "Play" button in the right preview window to see the result. If you're satisfied, hit "Export" and you'll go to the export window. As you see, this program offers four output ways. In the "Format" tab, you can save the new work in all popular formats such as AVI, MP4, MOV, FLV and much more. You can also convert your video to a YouTube compatible format for online sharing in the "YouTube" tab and immediately upload it. Or burn a DVD disk in minutes to watch it on your home cinema.
