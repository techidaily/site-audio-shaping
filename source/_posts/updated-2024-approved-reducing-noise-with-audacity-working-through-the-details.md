In general, modifying the male voice to a female voice, as the male pitch has a negative value and changing it to a positive pitch, modifies your voice to a female voice. What else could be better to use than the amazing Audacity voice changer? Let’s share the steps that will help you change your male voice to female.

Step 1: First, start by opening the Audacity audio editor. Once it has launched successfully, you should import the audio file. You can record audio with Audacity. Along with this, you can also import files from your device from the 'File' section, followed by the 'Open' option.

Step 2: After your audio track is visible on the timeline, you have to select the part of the file that you want to edit. You can easily select it by clicking and dragging the mouse. If not this, you can also work with the whole track; for this, simply click on the track name to select it.

Step 3: After you are satisfied with the selection, head to the top menu and select the 'Effects' options. A drop-down list appears after this, and you have to look for the 'Change Pitch' option and select it.

Step 4: Normally, you can adjust the pitch by taking help from the sliders, but you can also change the pitch manually by adding a percentage. The male pitch originally will have a negative value; change it and set a positive value. You can keep changing until you are satisfied.
