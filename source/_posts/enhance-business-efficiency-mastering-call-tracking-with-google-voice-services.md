By eliminating noise, each video part will have a similar sound profile. Meanwhile, this will create a smooth and uninterrupted audio experience for the viewers. Consistent audio quality is important in providing a seamless and unified viewing experience.

### 8\. Audio Reconstruction

Eliminating such noises from audio is very helpful for fixing older or damaged recordings. It enhances the quality and makes it easier to understand audio. You can even reconstruct your old audio files and keep them safe. This will also help you to improve the quality of your old audio files.
