This online voice changer doesnâ€™t let you adjust the [bit rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other audio recording setting, which makes it difficult to control the noise or the peak levels in the audio files you are creating. Additionally, Voice-changer features only a limited range of voice effects and it doesnâ€™t offer much more than the standard options that make your voice sound robotic or like you were talking from a cave. In addition, the voice recordings you modulate with this tool can only be saved in WAV format, since Voice-changer doesnâ€™t allow its users to choose the file format of the output audio files.

All audio files you edit with the Pitch Shifter tool are going to be saved in MP3 format.

### 7\. Voice Spice Recorder

You can record new audio or use the platformâ€™s Text-to-Speech option to start the voice changing process, but uploading a file to Voice Spice Recorder from your computer isnâ€™t available.
