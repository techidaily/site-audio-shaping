#### 2\. [KineMaster Pro](http://www.kinemaster.com/)

![add audio to android video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-pro.jpg)

If you are looking for an editing application with a bit more substance to it, than KineMaster Pro is your best option. There is a lot more substance found in this application that you may not be able to find elsewhere. Not only is the end product amazing, but it has a very well-designed user interface. The UI has a drag and drop interface that is really easy to use. You can adjust the video so that you get an amazing quality picture on your video, as well as offering a variety of templates so that you can really get a great video. One of the greatest features is that this app can support multiple audio tracks and allows the user to overlap these tracks. You can also include voiceover tracks as well. One downside to this app is that it is only available for certain Android phones. If your phone is not one of the supported devices, you will not be able to see it in the Google Play Store. You can get this for free, but it will watermark your videos if you do not have the pro version.

#### 3\. [Video Maker Pro Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=yong.app.videoeditor&hl=en)

![how to add audio to video on android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-maker-pro-free.jpg)

This is a bare-bones application that is very reminiscent of the original Google Movie Studio app. There is no real ability for any in-depth video editing in this app, which is one of its downsides. It can support a single track, but it is unable to support more layers than that. You can choose between a music track or a voiceover track but not both. It is easy to use and free with ads. This is a good option if you just want something basic and no-frills to mess around with.

#### 4\. [](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goseet.VidTrim&hl=en)VidTrim

![application for adding audio to video android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vidtrim-android.jpg)

This application is less for actual editing but can be very useful if you are merely looking to manipulate videos. It is very easy to use, but there are limited features to this application which may not be what you are looking for. You are able to add audio tracks to the video but as a result of the limited editing features, you cannot place them in any particular spot. There is a free and a pro version that does not have ads. If you want something very basic and easy to use, this is a great choice.

#### 5\. [](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wevideo-video-editor-and/okgjbfikepgflmlelgfgecmgjnmnmnnb?hl=en) WeVideo

![add audio to video android application](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-for-android.jpg)

This is not an app for people who want some serious video editing abilities. This application is more specialized for those people who want to share the videos on their social media accounts. It is a cloud-based application with a long process time that users may be annoyed with. There are very limited features available with this application. You can add in one of their ready-to-use songs for your videos but this will create a theme that will dictate how the rest of the video looks. Essentially, there really is little customization you can get with this. There is a free version, which does watermark the video, or a premium option that comes with a monthly fee.

"Can you add songs to iMovie? I need someone who can help me find a solution by providing a Detailed Guide on how to add songs in iMovie.”

It is a fact that iMovie is free for Apple users. There is a bit of a learning process that a user needs to go through before they start using it. It is also pertinant to understand that the simple process of adding a song to iMovie can be pretty tough if you do not understand the process.

Without delaying any further, let’s go through a quick detailed guide on how to add songs on iMovie as follows:

03 [Where can I get free songs to add to iMovie](#Part 3)

## Part 1 How to add Music to iMovie \[iPhone & Mac\]

iMovie provides Apple users with varieties of great opportunities, especially those who are much more interested in making videos to add transitions, cut clips, overlay titles, and do more on the platform. More so, for those using them already, you will notice that there are about five songs already, which can be somewhat overwhelming.

The good news is that Apple users can now add more songs on iMovie using the following steps:

For iPhone: there are different methods of adding songs to the iMovie project using your iPhone device:

### Add theme music and soundtrack

● While your project is still open, click on Add Media button +and then click on Audio.

● Click on Soundtracks and all the Soundtracks that you need to download will appear showing a Download button next to them.

● Click on a soundtrack you want to download and download it. After you download a soundtrack, you can click on it to preview.

● To download all the soundtracks, click on the Download button in the upper right.

● To add a soundtrack, click on the soundtrack you want to add and then click on the Add Audio option + that appears to add a soundtrack to your project.

● Scroll down to the Theme Music section available at the Soundtracks list and add theme music to your project to add theme music.

### Add background song stored on your device

● While your project is still open, click on Add Media button + and click on Audio.

● To look for songs previously synced to your device from your computer, click on My Music.

● To listen to a song before adding them, click on the song.

● To add a song to your iMovie project, click on the song and then click on the Add Audio button +.

### Add imported songs from an iCloud drive or other audio

Scroll the timeline so the white vertical line known as the ‘Playhead’ appears while your project is still open and select where you want to add the audio clip or songs.
