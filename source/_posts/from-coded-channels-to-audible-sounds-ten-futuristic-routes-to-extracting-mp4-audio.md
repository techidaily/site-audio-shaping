Sometimes the background music is very noisy or it has an unwanted part, we may want to remove that unwanted noise from recorded tracks to make the audio quality better, and we can also add more audio effects to polish the whole editing.

## How to Add Audio Effects to Video with Wondershare Filmora

It is much easier to edit an audio track with wondershare filmora in order to improve its overall quality. If you want to remove noise or unwanted audio signals from your videos, you can use the interactive features of wondershare where you can easily import, export files, and modify them with one click into the format you want. To achieve all these benefits, you can follow these steps:

#### Step 1\. Import your source files to Filmora

![import-source-files ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-source-files.jpg)

You can either drag and drop files to the media library directly or click the “Import” button to load as many audio or video files as you need.

#### Step 2\. Detach audio track from the video

![filmora9-detach-audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-detach-audio.jpg)

The next important step is to separate the noise or unwanted audio from the source video. In order to detach these audio signals, you need to right-click the video on the video track, then simply select Detach Audio, and the background sound of the video will be detached out to the audio track. Then you can modify or delete it as per your need without affecting the original video.

#### Step 3\. Do audio keyframing(fade in and fade out)

![filmora9-audio-fade](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-audio-fade.jpg)

After you detach the audio to the audio track, you can double click it on the track, and then you will see the Fade in and Fade out options (there are also some other audio settings such as volume, equalizer, and denoise). Just drag the slider on the Fade in and Fade out option to make smooth audio transitions directly, and then you will see the fade-in and fade-out waves on the timeline. All of this will make the editing very dramatic and full of personality.

#### Step 4\. Add Sound Effects

![add-audio-sound.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-audio-sound.jpg)

Simply go to the Audio tab, select Sound Effects, and then you will see a list of sound effects such as Atomic Bomb and Camera Snaps. Just drag the sound effect you like to the audio track and align it with your video.

#### Step 5\. Export your video

![filmora9-export-panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg)

Once you finish your editing on the timeline, you can click the Export button to save your video as mp4 or other supported formats. Or you can upload it to Youtube and Vimeo directly.
