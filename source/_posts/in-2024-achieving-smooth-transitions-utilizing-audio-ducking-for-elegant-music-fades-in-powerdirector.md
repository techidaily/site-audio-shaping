The download process is needlessly complicated since you make sure that the Save output to downloadable file checkbox is selected, then play the audio file for as long as you would like the output file to be, and then click on the link that is displayed in the Recordings section of the screen. All audio files you edit with the Pitch Shifter tool are going to be saved in MP3 format.

Besides selecting a low or high pitch you can also apply the Chipmunk or Mountain Troll preset voice effects to your audio recordings.

You can’t choose the output file format, and all voice recordings you edit with this tool are going to be saved in the WAV file format.

### 7\. [Voice Spice Recorder](https://voicespice.com/)

You can record new audio or use the platform’s Text-to-Speech option to start the voice changing process, but uploading a file to Voice Spice Recorder from your computer isn’t available. The platform provides you with a basic set of audio recording settings that enable you to choose how loud your microphone will be or if you want to apply an effect like Hell Demon, Space Squirrel, or change the voice from male to male female.

![change voice online with voicespice recorder](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-voice-with-online-voice-spice-recorder.jpg)
