One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.
      * Members are matched by their unique code.
      * On the site, you can video chat with others.
      * You can easily use the site's features.

#### **3\.** [**YouNow**](https://www.younow.com/)

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.
      * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.
      * You can also make friends and send and receive gifts from them

#### [**4\. TinyChat**](https://tinychat.com/)

![tiny-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiny-poster.png)

An alternative chat platform, TinyChat, offers chat rooms with video feeds of 12 each. With this chat site, you do not have to pay because you can invite people you know and set up topics for your chat. The platform offers the most extensive video and voice chat service online for five million minutes of airtime each day.

Numerous chat rooms are available, including those set up by residents of your area. TinyChat hosts live video streaming of TV shows that will let you watch them as they happen. If you can't find a topic that interests you, create one. With TinyChat, you can connect with others through your webcam through audio, video, or text communication, just like with Omegle.

TinyChat is also a browser-based IM client and can be accessed from a PC, mobile device, or browser. While Omegle does not offer coins or points for unlocking special achievements or increasing your chances of landing in the live directory, it does provide you with a chance to interact with other users. A 500-coin token will also be awarded to you if you promote your room via TinyChat.

**Features:**

      * The process of starting a video call is very simple.
      * There are no issues with the webcam.
      * In your chat, you can control how many people participate.
      * It's possible to block someone if you don't want to communicate with them.

#### **5**[**. FaceFlow**](https://www.faceflow.co)

![faceflow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/faceflow-poster.png)

Users can have up to three video chats at the same time with these guys, taking social networking to a whole new level. In addition to offering free video chat and video conferencing with your friends, you can also communicate with strangers via FaceFlow. The new feature allows users to create a searchable profile and share their favorite online videos and pictures.

Aside from being simply another webcam chat service, this site is more like the amazing services offered by Skype. There is a one-to-one video chat feature as well as text chat. Furthermore, FaceFlow has released a multiplayer game called Flappy in which you have to team up against someone in order to complete the game.

**Features**

      * Signing up takes no time at all;
      * The service supports five languages;
      * It has a modern interface;
      * It offers a lot of free features;
      * FaceFlow can connect with your friends and family while still using a dating website.

There are many websites similar to Omegle, but Camsurf has a unique twist - it is wild. If you're trying to have fun, then you should visit this website. CamSurf has consistently delivered the most bizarre video chats we've ever experienced. The CamSurf website itself is straightforward and almost identical to the OmeTV website.

These two have a major difference in the types of people they attract. CamSurf has a vastly wider audience than OmeTV. While some individuals on OmeTV are looking for genuine conversation, on CamSurf, you'll find people looking for genuine chat. It is our top choice for next time.

**Features:**

      * Feature-rich website.
      * A huge range of topics is available to discuss.

#### **7\.** [**ChatRad**](https://chatrad.com/)

![chatrad-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrad-poster.png)

This site claims to be a G-rated alternative to chat sites like Chatroulette, and it is quite harsh toward behavior that is not appropriate. People need to act the same in the real world, where they don't run around naked or try to expose themselves all of the time... at least not in my world. Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.

**Features:**

      * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People
      * The chat is moderated 24/7 by an active team of moderators.
      * It offers a very safe environment for people.

#### **8.**[**Bazoocam**](https://bazoocam.org/)

![bazoocam-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bazoocam-poster.png)

The Bazoocam webcam chat environment is another random digital camera chat site that maintains a high level of cleanliness. Like most of the other websites mentioned, you're paired up with an interloper haphazardly. Press "skip" and move on to the next person if you are unsatisfied with what you see.

As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you're bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music. Try playing a string or wind instrument, and you'll find many people to talk to.

**Features**

      * The site offers a very high level of cleanliness.
      * You can chat with the person of your choice.
      * If you don't like a person you can skip to check the next candidate.

It is similar to Omegle in that there are random live video chats and text chat rooms available, but iMeetzu goes over and above that. Once you get past the randomness, you are given the option of joining a free online dating service or friend finder.

Over a thousand new members are joining every day on this one of the fastest-growing social networking sites. If you're looking to find a date or if you practice your lines, this is the closest you can get to practice face-to-face before you dive back into the dating pool.

      * As it is a new platform so there are mostly genuine users.
      * You can do both text and video chats with strangers.

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.
      * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.

Users can have up to three video chats at the same time with these guys, taking social networking to a whole new level. In addition to offering free video chat and video conferencing with your friends, you can also communicate with strangers via FaceFlow. The new feature allows users to create a searchable profile and share their favorite online videos and pictures.

Aside from being simply another webcam chat service, this site is more like the amazing services offered by Skype. There is a one-to-one video chat feature as well as text chat.

CamSurf has consistently delivered the most bizarre video chats we've ever experienced. The CamSurf website itself is straightforward and almost identical to the OmeTV website.

These two have a major difference in the types of people they attract. CamSurf has a vastly wider audience than OmeTV. While some individuals on OmeTV are looking for genuine conversation, on CamSurf, you'll find people looking for genuine chat. It is our top choice for next time.

![chatrad-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrad-poster.png)

This site claims to be a G-rated alternative to chat sites like Chatroulette, and it is quite harsh toward behavior that is not appropriate. People need to act the same in the real world, where they don't run around naked or try to expose themselves all of the time... at least not in my world. Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.

**Features:**

      * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People
      * The chat is moderated 24/7 by an active team of moderators.

#### **8.**[**Bazoocam**](https://bazoocam.org/)

As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you're bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music.
