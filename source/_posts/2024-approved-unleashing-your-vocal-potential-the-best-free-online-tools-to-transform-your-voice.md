Here is **how to remove static noise from audio** with Filmora.

Step1 Upload Files

Open Wondershare Filmora and load your video into the timeline window. You can get a video preview, cut it up, and remove the bits you don't want to preserve.

Step2 Edit Audio

Select "Edit Audio" by using the context menu after right-clicking the movie in the timeline. You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the "Audio" option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.

Step3 Remove Background Static

Double-click on the audio track to eliminate the background noise directly, and pick "normal denoise" from the Edit Panel. You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video.

## Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?

So, that was **how to remove static sound from audio**. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?

If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.

If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn't there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.

Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.

Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.

One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.

## Conclusion

Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem? Video quality is vital, but audio noise can quickly damage your film. However, **removing static sound from audio** may be a pain in the neck. In addition, capturing clear audio may be challenging, particularly in areas with a lot of background noise.

Now you have an audio file with less or no noise and want to learn **how to remove static noise from audio**. With the above suggestions, I hope you'll find eliminating background noise from the video easy. If you want to be more creative in removing **static noise from audio**, try the Filmora video editor to give your mind a boost.

## Part 1: Why Is It Necessary to Get Rid of Background Noise in Videos and Audios?

You might wonder, if no one can avoid background noises, why remove them? However, there are many reasons why removing them is significant. Along with achieving high-quality videos, they have many advantages. This section of the **Audacity noise cancellation** article will discuss the reasons below:

### 1\. Effective Communication

If you’re a creator, professional, or marketer, audience communication is important. Digital platforms have eased this through videos and online streamlining platforms. You bring clarity to your speech for effective communication via noise reduction. A video without distractions hooks the viewers to the screen, and they focus better.

### 2\. Reflects Professionalism

Creators with international reach and vast audiences never compromise on audio quality. They post videos with zero background noises and audio enhancement effects. This is because such videos convey a professional brand or creator's image. No one likes a video with distracting traffic noises, wind noises, and others.

### 3\. High Production Value

Video without background noises builds a premium and consistent brand image. They convey a message that the brand cares for its audience's preferences. In addition, the production of such videos speaks for itself. The stakeholders also invest in such brands that care for brand image.

### 4\. Consistent Storytelling

With background noises out of the image, the storyline stays consistent. There are no unnecessary distractions that keep the audience off your videos. Those who create learning tutorials and explainer videos can benefit from this.

### 5\. Audience Accessibility

When creating content, you should keep your horizons vast and diverse. There are people who cannot listen properly and use hearing aids. The removal of background noises makes content accessible for those with disabilities. In addition, some people prefer to watch movies and videos without captions. Background noises will force them to stick to subtitles, which can be a turn-off.
