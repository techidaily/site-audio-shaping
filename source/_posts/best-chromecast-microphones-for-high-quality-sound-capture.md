Alternatively, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+I keyboard shortcut to select the file you’d like to import into the software.

The file will be displayed as a waveform and placed on the software’s timeline. You can then proceed to **select the portion of the file you’d like to reverse** by holding the left mouse button while dragging the mouse cursor between any two points within the file. Use the Ctrl+A shortcut to select the entire file or head over to the Edit menu, click on the Select option and **choose All** from the submenu.

## Best Audio Reverser Apps for iOS and Android

Listening to reversed versions of your favorite songs on your Smartphone can be a lot of fun, so if you would like to explore the possibilities of reversing audio directly from an iPhone or Android device you should check out these apps.

#### 1. [Reverse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipxel.audio.reverse.music.audio.player&hl=en%5FUS)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-music-player-android-audio-reverser.jpg)
