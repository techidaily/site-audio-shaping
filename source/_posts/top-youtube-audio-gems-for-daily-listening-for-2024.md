## Part 2 Check If A Song On YouTube Audio Library Is Copyright Protected?

As we discussed earlier, the YouTuber library has numerous songs free from copyright-related issues or hurdles. Due to it, anyone can easily use them in any video and proceed further. On the other hand, you cannot ignore the fact of having some copyright-protected audio files as well. In case you use a copyright-protected file in your video without the permission of the real owner or publisher, it will lead to legal actions or claim procedures.

Here, you may also find some YouTube audio library music files with copyright restrictions but are free to use in some considerations. Generally, these conditions are providing credit to the copyright holder in the video description and some other factors. It is the main reason why everyone should consider proper copyright check up before using any audio from the YouTube library. One careless step can lead to several problems.
