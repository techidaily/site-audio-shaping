## How to Extract Multiple Audio Tracks from the Video?

Here you’ll get to know how to extract audio from video with the use of [**Handbrake**](https://handbrake.fr/) software in order to extract multiple audio tracks from a video.

**Step 1:** Download and open handbrake software.

**Step 2:** You have to select a video having multiple audio tracks on “source selection” pane.

**Step 3:** File selection will generate an interface beneath. Select “audio tab” and expand the first dropdown which lists down all the audio tracks in a selected file. Select one of them and name the file and enter the output directory.

**Step 4:** Tap on “start encode” which will convert the audio in MP4 format. Now the audio extraction from the video is done using VLC player.

**Step 5:** Open the VLC player and select the “convert” option inside “media”.

**Step 6:** Tap on “add” in the Open Media pane then select the recently created handbrake video. From the drop-down next to the Convert/Save option, tap on “convert”.

**Step 7:** Below profile, tap on “MP3” on the following screen, name the file and enter the directory then select “start” and voila! You are done.

## How to Extract Audio from Streaming Video?

You can use [Video Downloader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-downloader-professi/elicpjhcidhpjomhibiffojpinpmmpil?hl=en) if you use Chrome as a web browser or [DownloadHelper](http://www.downloadhelper.net/) for Firefox users in order to download any streaming video as a file locally in your system. If one asks how to extract audio from the mp4 video, the process remains the same.

After the downloading process, there exist several programs for audio extraction from a video.

Below are the steps for the [VLC player](https://www.videolan.org/index.html):

**Step 1:** Open VLC player, select “media” then click “convert/save” option, click “Add” beside File Selection box.

**Step 2:** Browse the desired downloaded file from PC and press “OK”.

**Step 3:** Select “audio-MP3” from “profile” and then select “start”.

## Conclusion

Depending upon the availability of resources, all of the aforementioned approaches are great in their own way.

But considering that Wondershare filmora runs smoothly given the easiest interface and requiring least steps to perform audio extraction whilst being compatible with Mac and Windows both operating system, I would personally recommend this software for ease of accessibility and usability.
