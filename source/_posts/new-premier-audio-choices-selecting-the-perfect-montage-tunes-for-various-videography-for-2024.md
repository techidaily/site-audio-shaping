## Premier Audio Choices: Selecting the Perfect Montage Tunes for Various Videography

Montage is a film editing technique that combines a series of clips or shots into a single sequence. Background music is often applied to the final montage during compilation. We'll look at some of the best montage music for different video types and the benefits of adding them to your montage video.

## Why Music Is Important for Montage Video

Music plays an essential role in montage videos. Here are five reasons why you should add music to your montage video.

#### 1\. Music Captures Attention

One of the reasons people include music in montage videos is that it holds the audience's attention; it shapes emotion while motivating viewers. In addition to touching viewers, music makes the moving images in your montage video seem more beautiful and engaging. It also brings mood and dynamism to the video.

Musicologists have discovered that the choice of musical instruments, volume, harmony, and tempo play a vital role in montage video.

#### 2\. Music Takes Your Montage Video to the Next Level

By using music, you'll boost the cohesiveness and production value of your montage video. Your audience wants a professional montage video that is well-constructed and flows nicely. Music is the bridge that lets your montage video transition seamlessly between different scenes or ideas, particularly when you need to have a jump cut.

Additionally, montage music is a great way to fill in moments in your montage video that would have been silent. You can also use it to fill dead air in your video where there is a visual without sound.

#### 3\. Music Helps You to Communicate Your Message

Music is a vital component in conveying your message in your montage video. The music in your video should be in tune with the message you are trying to send.

#### 4\. Helps to Underscore the Unfolding Action

Montage music helps you to emphasize the action taking place in your video. As a result, this will make your audience focus on the action and get your message.

#### 5\. Helps You Create Rhythm for Your Montage Video

Music allows you to create a rhythm for scenes and clips in your montage video. A good rhythm can hold up your entire montage video.

Understanding and knowing the layout of your software before you start working on it is essential. The crucial components of REAPER software include the Timeline, Arrangement Window, Track Panel, Toolbar, and lastly, Transport.

![reaper layout understanding](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-3.jpg)

The Arrangement window holds all the added items. The items are played from left to right order, similar to their timeline arrangement. You can also zoom in and out. Then comes the transport toolbar, which holds the functions to stop, rewind, play, fast forward, adjust the timeline speed, etc. The toolbar holds all the toggle buttons. You can also customize your toolbar.

### New Track Creation

For creating a new track on REAPER, go to the Track menu and hit Insert New Track. A track is like another layer to your audio. Multiple layers and tracks make your work complex yet interesting as you can play all the different tracks at the same time. By double-clicking in the Track Control Panel, you can set a name for the added track.

### Audio Hardware Settings for Audio Recording

It is best suggested always to check your audio hardware settings before you start to record, edit or mix with REAPER Recording Software. Your primary focus should be on the recording device's devices should be set as Input Device, whereas the listening device should be set as the Output Device.

For this, you have to select Preferences from the Options menu. A window will appear in front of you, the REAPER Preference window. You have to select the correct Input and Output devices from the dropdown menu from this window.

### Arm your Track

Arming your track is very important. For this, head over to the Track Control Panel, and next to your track name, hit the red circle. If you have various tracks, you should solo this track and mute the other tracks.

As soon as the track is armed, a Gain Meter will activate on the side. From this, you can check if you have properly set the microphone or not. This could be tested by tapping on the microphone.

### Record

After all, the hardware settings are done, and your track is armed, it's time to start the recording. For that, just tap on the Record button in the Transport toolbar. A yellow line in the timeline will indicate the end of the recording.

![initiate audio recording](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-7.jpg)

To end the recording, tap on the Stop button from the Transport Toolbar. Lastly, REAPER Recording Software will ask you to save the file. In case you don't want it, you can also delete it.

### Create and Manipulate Clips

Things like manipulation get a lot easier if you split the clips in REAPER. From the items menu, you have to select the option of Split Item on Cursor. This divides your clip into two clips on each side of the cursor. You can also remove the clips by going to the Items Menu. From there, you just have to hit the Remove Item option, or else, simply press the Delete key on your keyboard.

![split your recorded audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-8.jpg)

Removing clips will create a gap in the arrangement window that can be filled by dragging forward the remaining clip.

### Volume Adjustments – Normalize

By double-clicking on the item or by selecting 'Item Properties' from a right-click, you can normalize the item. A new window will appear as Media Item Properties, from where you have to locate the Volume Settings and then select the option of Normalize.

If your item is already loud, then nothing will happen, but if it is not, then the slider will change from 0.00 dB showing an increase in the volume. Lastly, hit the 'Apply' or 'OK' button to imply the changes.

### Fade in/out

With the Media Properties, you can also adjust a Fade in and a Fade out. For this, you simply have to set an end time for the Fade in, whereas a start time is entered for Fade out. Hit the 'Ok' or 'Apply' button to apply the changes.

From the Arrangement window, fades can be adjusted. For adjusting the fades, hover with your mouse over the red line. You will see a newly shaped cursor. Just drag on the timeline to play and adjust the Fade with this new cursor.

![apply fade in and fade out](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/reaper-recording-software-9.jpg)

### Automate Changes

With REAPER, you can also automate changes in track parameters. We will guide about automation from Track Envelopes. From Track Control Panel, hit the Trim option. A new Envelopes window will open at this point from where you have to check the Volume box.

A new Volume Track will open up. Here, you have to set new Envelope points. That could be done by holding the shift key, right-clicking on the point, and then selecting Create New Point. A green circle will indicate the new point.

By dragging the Envelope point, you can also adjust the volume. Dragging it towards the top will increase the volume, whereas dragging it towards the bottom will eventually decrease.

### Finalize the Audio – Render

After all the above steps have been completed to set the order and adjust your desired volume, the last step comes to render your project file. For that, move to the File menu and select the 'Render' option. A window will be opened as 'Render to File.' Now, from the dropdown menu, select your desired Output Format.

Lastly, hit the Render 1 File button, and then REAPER will export your project. You can immediately listen to it by selecting the 'Launch File' option.
