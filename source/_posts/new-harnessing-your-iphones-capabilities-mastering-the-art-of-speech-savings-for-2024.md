### Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool

This tool is best as it gives a perfect result when you try to match your audio files with your video files. For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg)

First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg)

## Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video

The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.

## Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro

* **Step 1**: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).

![import files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg)

* **Step 2**: Now, you may have either used a professional slate/clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.

![merge audio manually](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg)

* **Step 3**: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.

![finish sync audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/finish-sync-audio.jpg)

## Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly

Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a [quality microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and an [audio recorder](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/) that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.

The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1/8” jacks.

You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.

### Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool

This tool is best as it gives a perfect result when you try to match your audio files with your video files. For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg)

First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg)

Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.

![Sync Audio to Video in Filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-5.jpg)

Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.

## Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video

The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.

* To proceed, press **Control** and **Command**\> key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click **OK**.

![Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-premiere-pro.jpg)

* Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.

## Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro

* **Step 1**: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).

![import files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg)

* **Step 2**: Now, you may have either used a professional slate/clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.

![merge audio manually](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg)

* **Step 3**: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.

![finish sync audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/finish-sync-audio.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in

[PluralEyes](https://www.redgiant.com/products/shooter-pluraleyes/) is the next ideal option to work with. It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.

* For this, run PluralEyes and hit on **Add Media** to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on **Synchronize** and let the program do the job.

![PluralEyes sync audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sync-audio-PluralEyes.jpg)

* You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click **Try Really Hard**.
* When the entire files are synced, hit on **Export Timeline** and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.

## Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly

Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a [quality microphone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and an [audio recorder](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/) that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.

The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1/8” jacks.

You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.

Many of us get the first association when Adobe After Effects is mentioned: stunning motion graphics and breathtaking visual effects. Very few people think of audio editing when they talk about AE, even though this application offers a simple way to add Fade in and fade out effects to audio files used in soundtracks.

However, you will need to have at least basic video and sound editing skills to fade in and fade out audio files in AE since the app doesn't offer a preset that you can drag and drop to the timeline. So, in this article, we will show how to create the Fade in and fade out effects in Adobe After Effects in just a few simple steps.

 **Read More to Get:** [Best Audio Mixer Software to Trim Your Sound Easily >>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Adding the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Audio Files in AE

### Step 1: Check audio waveform in After Effects

Once you've created a new project in AE and you've imported the audio files you'd like to include in the soundtrack of the video you're making, you should place that audio file on the timeline. Click on the arrow located next to the audio file, then click on the Audio arrow that will be displayed under the file, and finally click on the Waveform arrow. This will enable you to see the waveform of the audio file you'd like to edit on the timeline and allow you to add Fade in and fade out effects with more precision. The file you added to your composition will be displayed as a layer in the Composition tab located in the lower-left region of the software's interface.

![fade out/in audio waveform after effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/fade-out-in-audio-after-effects-waveform.jpg)

### Step 2: Add a keyframe to the audio file

The next thing you will have to do is place the playhead at the exact location where you want the Fade In effect to start. In most cases, Fade effects are added at the starting point of the audio file, so you should position the playhead at the beginning of the timeline or zero seconds. You will be able to see a stopwatch next to the Audio Levels option located in the Composition tab. Click on it to add the first keyframe and assign a negative value to the Audio Level setting. -100db or -50db values will make the audio file silent, and you can pick either based on how long you want the Fade in effect to last. If you don't know how to use keyframes in After Effects, [this article will give you some info](https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/how-to-set-keyframes-after-effects).

### Step 3: Complete Fade out/in audio in After Effects

Move the playhead to the location where you want the effect to end and add another keyframe by clicking on the 'Add or remove keyframe at current time' icon. Set the Audio Level value to 0db, and that is it. You've created the Fade in effect. Keep in mind that you can use more than two keyframes to fade in audio, enabling you to increase the audio level gradually. The process of creating the Fade effect requires you to add a keyframe that has a 0db value a few seconds before the clip ends and then add another keyframe at the very end of the audio file that has -50 or -100db audio level value.

![Complete fade out/in audio in After Effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/complete-fade-iin-out-audio-after-effects.jpg)

## Tips For Making Better Fade In and Fade Out Effects

The process of creating a fade in or a fade out effect in AE is quite simple, but it is up to you to discover creative ways of using these effects. Here are a few tips that can help you use these audio effects more creatively.

### 1\. Avoid Hard Cuts

A high pitch sound at the very begging of a new sequence can ruin your soundtrack and ultimately the entire video, so in case you've cut an audio file at the location where the sound peaks, you can apply a fade in effect to make the transition between two audio files softer.

You may also like: [How to Cut Video in After Effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2\. Be Mindful of Audio Compression

[Audio compression](https://theproaudiofiles.com/compression-techniques/) is a process that reduces loud sounds and amplifies quiet sounds, resulting from the audio file's dynamic range being compressed. In most cases, you won't notice the effects of audio compression, but if you compress an audio file too much, you might get some unwanted side effects if you add a fade out effect to that file. That's why it is best to rely on the default audio compression features a video or audio editing app offers.

### 3\. Use the Fade In and Fade Out Effects Creatively

Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.

## Conclusion

Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn't require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE? Leave a comment below and share your experiences with us.

If you want to fade in/out audio easily, we recommend using [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It is designed for people who wish to edit professional videos with simple-to-use features. Besides Fade in/out audio in Filmora, you can automatically sync audio to video.

Besides opening and closing scenes, you can also use the Fade in and fade out effects to mix two different tracks while the shot is still in progress. Fade out one track, make it look like a scene is ending, and then introduce a new theme that changes the mood of that scene. The important thing is to avoid reducing the audio level all the way to -100db because you might end up creating silence in a scene that disrupts the flow of an entire video.

## Conclusion

Fading in or fading out audio files in Adobe After Effects doesn't require much effort, as you have to add a few keyframes to the file and adjust the Audio Level value. However, finding the best way to improve the quality of your soundtrack by applying these effects may take some practice. Do you often add Fade in and fade out audio effects in AE?
