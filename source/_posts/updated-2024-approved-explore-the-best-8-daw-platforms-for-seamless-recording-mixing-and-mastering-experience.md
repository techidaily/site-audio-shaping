## "Elevate Your Listening Experience: Top 10 Audio Compressors and Expanders for Windows (2 Written by an AI Developer)

An audio normalizer is a tool that helps to change the overall volume of audio by a set amount to reach a predetermined level. In simple words, it can be defined as turning up the volume of an audio file without losing the audio quality.

Sound normalization is done for mainly two reasons. One is to increase the volume of a quiet audio file without making changes in its dynamic range for easy and better hearing. The other reason is to achieve matching volumes for different audio files.

 While the sound of the audio gets increased during audio normalization, the noise will also get increased. So make sure that normalization is done properly within the right limit.

## Top 10 Audio Normalizers for Windows

Audio normalization was commonly done in the early days when digital audio was enjoyed. The performance of many audio components was limited in signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range, and sound normalization helped.

Normalization is still a useful feature that helps to equalize volume in different files. Let us look at some of the best audio normalizers available in Windows.

The audio will be analyzed and normalized automatically within some time.

### 2\. [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

Audacity is a free and open-sourced audio software used on all operating systems. Its simple interface and compatibility across different platforms are the main reasons for its popularity.

Open audacity, click on Effect from the top toolbar, and then select Normalize. Three different options will be given for you to apply.

You can remove the DC offset, independently normalize stereo channels or normalize the maximum amplitude to your desired decibel.

### 3\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

As you all might know Adobe premium pro is a wonderful video editing application used by beginners and professionals alike. To normalize audio on adobe premium pro, go to the timeline, right-click on the audio file, and tap on Audio Gain…

A small window will appear, from which you can select the Normalize Max Peak to: option. The dB can be manually adjusted to your desired limit.

Click OK after making the necessary adjustments, and the changes will take place instantly.

### 4\. [MP3Gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/)
