## Benefits of Adding Sound Effects in Podcasts

Before discussing what tools can help editors add sound effects to podcast episodes, we should refresh on why it is vital. Here are some of the best benefits you can expect from inserting sound effects for podcasts:

* **Thematic or mood setting**

With a sound effect, you can portray a specific theme for your podcast that gives the users an instant feel of your brand/channel.

Comedy or commentary podcasts can use mood-based sound effects like a laugh track with their content.

* **Point emphasis**

Many podcasters utilize sound effects at pivotal moments of their content, e.g., to emphasize a cliffhanger in story-form podcast episodes. Like the boding and italicizing methods are useful in text documents to emphasize parts, you can adjust sound effects to do the same for your audio-based content. These can accentuate the dialogue and evoke specific emotional responses from the audience.
