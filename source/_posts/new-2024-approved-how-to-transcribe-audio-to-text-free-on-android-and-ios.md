* Install Audacity via PPA
* Install Audacity via Snap Store

First, we'll use the PPA approach to install Audacity.

### Install Audacity via PPA

Installing Audacity on an Ubuntu system is as simple as entering the following line in the terminal to include the unofficial PPA developed by "ubuntuhandbook" to the Ubuntu system's software sources, then rebooting.

![install-audacity-snap-store-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-snap-store-step1.png)

You will be prompted to hit the Enter key to proceed with the process of adding your Audacity package to your sources list. To begin the process of introducing PPA to the sources list, press the Enter key.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step2.png)

After you've added the Audacity package to the system's software sources, you'll need to update the package repository in order to get Audacity to work.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step3.png)

As soon as you have updated the package repository, you should be able to successfully install Audacity.

Navigate to Activities & type in the word 'audacity' to find it.

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step4.png)

![install-audacity-via-ppa-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step5.png)

### Installing Audacity from the Snap Store

A version of Audacity is also available for download via the Snap shop. Using a Snap is among the quickest and most straightforward methods of installing any program since it takes into account all of the application's updates and dependencies. In order to install Audacity using Snap, you must first ensure that Snap is already installed on the Ubuntu system. Snap is pre-installed in the newest versions of Ubuntu and is available as a default. If Snap is not already installed on your system, you may do it by using the instructions shown below.
