Transcribing the audio and video recordings of interviews and meetings can help you to understand better the data you collected. Even if you are creating video content, a transcription can assist you in increasing its visibility on search engines. Transcribing a recording of any kind can make it easier to organize and archive the information the recording contains, and it enables you to have easy access to this data whenever you need it.

However, transcribing a single video or audio file can be a painstakingly long and time-consuming process. That is why opting for an **automatic transcription software** is the right choice for you if you are looking for a way to save time on audio and video transcription.

In this article, we are going to take you through some of the **best automatic transcription software** products and help you choose the one that best fits your needs.

## The Best Automatic Transcription Software in 2020

Even though a quick Google search is going to reveal a broad spectrum of different automatic transcription software products that are advertised as free, you will still have to purchase a license or a subscription if you want to use all of their features. Let’s take a look at some of the best automatic transcription software in 2020, including free and paid solutions both.

### 1. Trint

The software is equipped with advanced text-to-speech algorithms that can transcribe audio and video recordings in a broad range of different languages, including all dialects of the English language.

Once the automatic transcription process is completed, you can use the software’s text editor to improve the quality of the transcription and then embed a searchable transcript to your website. However, the number of available features depends on the pricing plan you choose.

The platform’s algorithms have advanced punctuation capabilities that enable it to use commas, question marks, and full-stops correctly. Furthermore, Happy Scribe’s text editor provides proofreading help so that you can easily identify parts of the text that need to be tightened up.

The platform sends you a link to your email once the transcription is completed so that you can edit the text. The app’s online text editor grants you complete control over the timecoded transcript and it allows you to speed up the playback of the file you are transcribing or quickly jump to a particular part of the recording.

The web-based automatic transcription software is equipped with a powerful proprietary algorithm that identifies different speakers effortlessly and allows you to create custom timestamps.

Once the transcript is generated you can use the platform’s text editing tools to polish it, although you should keep in mind that Temi offers only basic text editing options. Besides using Temi from a web browser, you can also install the Temi app on your Android or your iPhone and transcribe all audio or video content you capture with your Smartphone just moments after recording it.

The web-based automatic transcription software is equipped with a powerful proprietary algorithm that identifies different speakers effortlessly and allows you to create custom timestamps.

Once the transcript is generated you can use the platform’s text editing tools to polish it, although you should keep in mind that Temi offers only basic text editing options. Besides using Temi from a web browser, you can also install the Temi app on your Android or your iPhone and transcribe all audio or video content you capture with your Smartphone just moments after recording it. However, the accuracy of the transcript largely depends on the quality of the recording, as transcripts of videos or audio recordings that contain heavy background noise are mostly unusable.

**Pros**

* Affordable, and easy to use
* Allows users to upload all types of audio and video files
* Features Speaker Identification technology
* Quick turnaround

**Cons**

* Temi can only transcribe audio and video files in the English language
* The accuracy of the transcription depends on the quality of the recording

### 6. Otter

**Price:** Free, pricing plans start at $8.33 per month

**Compatibility:** Web-based, iOS, Android

Otter is a great option for anyone in need of an online app that allows them to make audio recordings and transcribe them in real-time. The platform is equipped with speaker identification technology, and it grants you access to a variety of text editing and file-sharing options. However, you cannot transcribe more than 600 hours of content per month with the free version of Otter.

Furthermore, you will have to opt for either the Premium or the Team subscription model if you want to upload prerecorded audio and video files to Otter. The bulk import and export options, a custom vocabulary, or syncing video and audio directly from Dropbox are just a few among numerous options you will have at your disposal if you get a monthly subscription. However, capturing live notes in Zoom meetings, time codes or shared speaker voiceprints are only available within the Team subscription plan.

**Pros**

* Offers 600 hours of free transcriptions each month
* Transcribes audio recordings in real-time
* Allows users to sync Zoom cloud recordings
* Excellent collaboration features

**Cons**

* Importing audio or video files is not possible on the free version of Otter
* Time codes are only available within the Team subscription model

## Part 2: 3 Tips for Choosing an Automatic Transcription Software

The features of automatic transcription software products offer vary, which is the reason why checking the software’s list of features is the first thing you need to do while searching for a new automatic transcription software. The accuracy with which a software transcribes audio and video files, the amount of text editing tools it offers, or the number of supported languages are just a few among numerous aspects you have to consider before deciding which automatic transcription software you should get.

You don’t have to worry about the software’s compatibility, as you just need a web browser to use any of the automatic subscription software products we featured in this article. However, if you want to transcribe audio and video files from your Smartphone, you should check if the app is compatible with your device and its operating system.

There are only a handful of automatic transcription software products on the market that can be used free of charge, which is why you need to decide if you want to pay per minute of transcription or get a monthly subscription. So, if you are transcribing hundreds of hours of audio and video content each month, it is more affordable to purchase a monthly subscription while paying per minute of transcription is a better option if you don’t transcribe audio and video files often.

### Part 3: Automatic Transcription Software FAQs

#### What is Automatic Transcription?

Automatic transcription is the process during which AI algorithms listen to an audio or video file and transcribe it into text. All automatic transcription software products are equipped with a Speech-to-Text technology that generates text with varying levels of accuracy. That’s the reason why nearly all automatic transcription software products have text editors that allow you to identify and correct mistakes quickly.

#### What are the Biggest Benefits of Automatic Transcription?

Transcribing an audio or video file manually can take a lot of time and effort, while automatic transcription allows you to generate a transcript in just a few minutes. Afterward, you can just edit the text and use it to access important information quickly or upload it to your website in order to increase its visibility on search engines.

**Conclusion**

You don’t have to spend countless hours on audio and video file transcriptions since automatic transcription software products offer a simple solution. What’s more, you won’t even have to go through the software installation process, as each of the automatic transcriptions software products we featured in this article can be used from a web browser.
