## How to Convert MP3 to Text with Filmora

The Speech to Text effect makes it seem like someone's words are transformed into text on your screen! Consider making several text tracks and beginning the next one a little later than the previous if you want to create a pause in the phrase.

##### Step1 – Add file and select speech to text feature

You can do this in four ways.

A. Select the audio asset on the timeline, then go to Tools > Audio > Speech-to-Text in the top menu bar.

![Upload files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/filmora1.jpg)

B. In the Media resource box, right-click the video/audio with the audio track and choose Speech-to-Text.

![Detect video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/filmora2.jpg)

C. Once you've selected an audio asset, click the speech-to-text tool icon in the toolbar; if there is no compatible file type on the timeline, it will not appear.

![Scenes detected automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/filmora3.jpg)

D. Right-click on the audio asset in the timeline and pick Speech-to-Text from the context menu that appears.

## Notice and Tips When Converting MP3 to Text

### Keeping it Confidential

Online services present yet another potentially serious issue: privacy. Your audio file is stored on someone else's server since you have to submit it to the service.

Your audio might be revealed to the public if that service is ever hacked or someone working there is not honest. In some circumstances, this may not be an issue, but in others, it might be a major one. In certain sectors, it might result in legal issues and large penalties. Many online voice to text services aren't an option if you operate in a profession with tight privacy rules, such as healthcare.

### Audio-to-text PC software is Better

While there are certain drawbacks to computer-assisted transcribing, it is not without merit. It's a cheap method to convert your audio, and it can "learn" from its errors and improve over time thanks to the newest machine learning technologies. Simple audio material, taking notes, and other tasks with a low degree of complexity are best handled by software or web-based solutions. Even so, you'll have to proofread everything and make a significant number of mistakes.

It's also beneficial in cases when accuracy is less crucial than having the material translated to text, such as contact center monitoring. If the material is only being read internally, perfection may be less essential than speed and cost.

## Bottom Line

Do you wish to convert an MP3 file to a text file and transcribe a speech? You may utilize the online auto transcribing tool provided by Filmora! It's quick and simple to operate. Say goodbye to hours of manually transcribing audio transcriptions and welcome to automated transcriptions that just take a few clicks. There is no software to download; everything is done online.

Simply upload your audio recording, then choose the Auto Transcribe option. You may make minor changes to the transcription if necessary. WAV, M4A, and other common audio formats are all supported by Filmora's speech-to-text service.

## Notice and Tips When Converting MP3 to Text

### Keeping it Confidential

Online services present yet another potentially serious issue: privacy. Your audio file is stored on someone else's server since you have to submit it to the service.

Your audio might be revealed to the public if that service is ever hacked or someone working there is not honest. In some circumstances, this may not be an issue, but in others, it might be a major one. In certain sectors, it might result in legal issues and large penalties. Many online voice to text services aren't an option if you operate in a profession with tight privacy rules, such as healthcare.

### Audio-to-text PC software is Better

While there are certain drawbacks to computer-assisted transcribing, it is not without merit. It's a cheap method to convert your audio, and it can "learn" from its errors and improve over time thanks to the newest machine learning technologies. Simple audio material, taking notes, and other tasks with a low degree of complexity are best handled by software or web-based solutions. Even so, you'll have to proofread everything and make a significant number of mistakes.

It's also beneficial in cases when accuracy is less crucial than having the material translated to text, such as contact center monitoring. If the material is only being read internally, perfection may be less essential than speed and cost.

## Bottom Line

Do you wish to convert an MP3 file to a text file and transcribe a speech? You may utilize the online auto transcribing tool provided by Filmora! It's quick and simple to operate. Say goodbye to hours of manually transcribing audio transcriptions and welcome to automated transcriptions that just take a few clicks. There is no software to download; everything is done online.

Simply upload your audio recording, then choose the Auto Transcribe option. You may make minor changes to the transcription if necessary. WAV, M4A, and other common audio formats are all supported by Filmora's speech-to-text service.
