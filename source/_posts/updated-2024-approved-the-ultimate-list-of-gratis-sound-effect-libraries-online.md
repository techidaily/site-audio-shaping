## Part 2: Software for mixing audio tracks into one file in a video

There are several professional audio editing software available that give you good results. By installing them on your computer, you’ll be able to cut, slice, mix or apply filters of your own choice to your audio tracks. Here are some examples of the most popular and effective audio editing tools available in the market.

### 1.[Adobe Audition (Win/Mac)](https://adobe-audition.en.softonic.com/)

Adobe Audition is a powerful audio editing software that provides you with all the necessary tools for editing, splicing, mixing, and merging soundtracks and various audio filters. A user-friendly interface like all other Adobe products, Adobe Audition has excellent multitrack recording and high-quality audio restoration facilities.

![Adobe Audition](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Adobe%20Audition.jpg)

### 2. [Ableton Live (Win/Mac)](https://www.ableton.com/en/)

Ableton Live is yet another audio-editing software popular among professionals nowadays. It offers a host of built-in features, tools, filters, and pre-loaded effects that will help you to mix audio files and create your track.

![Ableton Live](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Ableton%20Live.jpg)

### 3. [Avid Pro Tools (Win/Mac)](http://www.avid.com/pro-tools)

Avid Pro Tools are extremely useful if you want to merge and mix an entire album in a fraction of a time. It has its studio-standard built-in instruments and offers a range of effects and filters to make your track perfect.

![Avid Pro Tools](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Avid%20Pro%20Tools.jpg)

**Cons of using the usual professional software:**

However, this professional editing software might not be the most suitable tool for you. There are a number of disadvantages of using them.

* Firstly, if you are a computer novice, these tools are never meant for you. Only if you have substantial experience working with computers will you be able to manage and manipulate the tools and achieve intended results. The functions of different built-in instruments and features can appear to be complicated sometimes.
* While working with videos, the usual method is somewhat complex. You’d have to extract the audio from the video file first and then apply that to the editing tools.
* While the work is in progress, checking whether the audio track matches the video is very difficult. To do that, you’d have to wait until the job is done.

Wondershare Filmora is undoubtedly the best alternative you’d find in the market and is certainly more appropriate for you. This easy-to-use software is probably the best tool available to an amateur who wants to mix audio tracks or merge them into video clips with a professional output.
