For attaining a perfect balance between voiceovers and the background audio, the concept of “ducking” is implemented. I have come up with this post to help you know more about <strong>audio ducking</strong> and its importance. I will also include a detailed guide for <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >implementing audio ducking on a video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> in a stepwise manner. Let’s begin!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="What is Audio Ducking"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Audio Ducking?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: When to Use Audio Ducking?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Use the Audio Ducking Feature in Filmora?</a></li></ul><h2 id="Audio-Ducking-What-Is-It-All-About"><a href="#Audio-Ducking-What-Is-It-All-About" class="headerlink" title="Audio Ducking: What Is It All About?"></a>Audio Ducking: What Is It All About?</h2><p>In nutshell, it is a process that “ducks” or lowers the background volume when a voiceover appears. For instance, let’s consider that we already have a background score in our video playing. When we would add a narrator’s voice or apply a voiceover, it would create a lot of confusion. Therefore, we implement the audio ducking process to lower the background audio and amplify the voiceover instead.</p><p>In most cases, it is achieved through a side-chain compression technique. A control channel is set up that enables the compression of one sound (the background) while amplifying another (the voiceover).</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><h2 id="When-Do-You-Need-to-Implement-Audio-Ducking"><a href="#When-Do-You-Need-to-Implement-Audio-Ducking" class="headerlink" title="When Do You Need to Implement Audio Ducking?"></a>When Do You Need to Implement Audio Ducking?</h2><p>Since the concept of audio ducking is pretty useful, it can be implemented in different ways during the video editing process. While you can apply the process to any video, here are some of the major instances where it is used.</p><h4 id="Travel-Vlogs"><a href="#Travel-Vlogs" class="headerlink" title="Travel Vlogs"></a>Travel Vlogs</h4><p>If you are a travel vlogger, you might already know how tough it can be to make yourself heard in a video. When there are too many background noises, your voice can be diminished. This is exactly where you can apply audio ducking to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >decrease the background noise <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and focus on your voice.</p><h4 id="Make-up-Tutorials"><a href="#Make-up-Tutorials" class="headerlink" title="Make-up Tutorials"></a>Make-up Tutorials</h4><p>While creating make-up video tutorials, most of us use a background track to keep our viewers engaged. At the same time, you need to let them know about the process by speaking clearly. If you use audio ducking, then you can easily attain a perfect balance between both sounds.</p><h4 id="Other-Instances"><a href="#Other-Instances" class="headerlink" title="Other Instances"></a>Other Instances</h4><p>Ideally, if you are creating any other tutorial video for your audience, then audio ducking can be useful.

Import Your Videos on Filmora"></a>Step 1.  Import Your Videos on Filmora</h4><p>To begin with, you have to install Wondershare Filmora on your computer and launch it. Now, go to the “Import” feature from the top, choose to add files, and browse and load your videos. After adding the video, you can drag it to the timeline below to start editing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-video-audio-files.jpg"                      alt="Import Files"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Import-An-Audio-or-Record-Voiceovers"><a href="#Step-2-Import-An-Audio-or-Record-Voiceovers" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.  Import An Audio or Record Voiceovers"></a>Step 2.  Import An Audio or Record Voiceovers</h4><p>Let’s suppose that your video already has an audio track in the background, and now you wish to add another audio component. Most of the people would like to record their voices in the video. For this, you can click on the voiceover (mic) icon at the bottom of the preview panel. This will open a dedicated window so that you can start recording your voice for the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-voiceovers-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="Record Voiceover for Audio Ducking"                ></p><p>Apart from that, you can also go to the “Import” feature to add any other audio component to the project. Besides that, Wondershare Filmora also has a wide range of royalty-free audio files that you can easily add to your projects.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/royalty-free-audio-files.jpg"                      alt="Royalty-free Audio files for Audio Ducking"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Apply-Audio-Ducking-to-Your-Video"><a href="#Step-3-Apply-Audio-Ducking-to-Your-Video" class="headerlink" title="Step 3.  Apply Audio Ducking to Your Video"></a>Step 3.  Apply Audio Ducking to Your Video</h4><p>After adding the second audio component, you can view it under the video timeline on Filmora. Now, you need to select the audio track you wish to amplify (like your voiceover) and not the track that already has a prominent volume.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/apply-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="Apply Audio Ducking"                ></p><p>Once you have selected the audio you wish to amplify, right-click to get its context menu. Just select the “Adjust Audio” feature from all the available options.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/right-click-adjust-audio.jpg"                      alt="Adjust Audio Ducking"                ></p><p>This will launch a dedicated window on the screen with various audio options to apply. Go to the “Ducking” option here and enable the “Lower the volume of other clips” feature. You can also use a slider here to adjust how much you wish to lower the volume of other clips in the project.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/audio-ducking-lower-other-clips.png"                      alt="Audio Ducking"                ></p><p>That’s it! Once you have selected the value, click on the “OK” button. You can now preview the results on Filmora and check that the volume of other audio components has been ducked. You can later go to the “Export” option and save the project in the format of your choice.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preview-audio-ducking.jpg"                      alt="Preview Audio Ducking"                ></p><p>After reading this post, I’m sure that you will know more about audio ducking and how we can implement it. Since many content creators encounter issues while working on their videos, audio ducking would certainly be a helpful feature. With an application like Wondershare Filmora, you can easily implement audio ducking on multiple files and further edit your videos like a pro!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Filmora Mac Version"                > </a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Benjamin Arango</p><p>Benjamin Arango is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Benjamin Arango</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-unlocking-the-potential-of-gopro-hero5-in-time-lapse-cinematography/"><u>[New] Unlocking the Potential of GoPro Hero5 in Time-Lapse Cinematography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-enhancing-post-reach-via-hashtags-on-instagram/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to Enhancing Post Reach via Hashtags on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/updated-androids-role-in-virtual-reality-content-consumption/"><u>[Updated] Android's Role in Virtual Reality Content Consumption</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ed-identifying-causes-for-disappearing-youtube-shorts-thumbnails-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Identifying Causes for Disappearing YouTube Shorts Thumbnails for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-recovering-a-stopped-up-link-to-your-obs-cam/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Recovering a Stopped-Up Link to Your OBS Cam</u></a></li><li><a href="https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-rapid-video-grabber-and-audible-guide-system/"><u>2024 Approved Rapid Video Grabber & Audible Guide System</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-blog.techidaily.com/10-free-youtube-subtitle-extractors-and-downloaders/"><u>Best 10 Free YouTube Subtitle Extractors & Downloaders</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-vault-of-unrestricted-guitar-resources-background-sounds-and-artwork-for-2024/"><u>New Vault of Unrestricted Guitar Resources Background Sounds and Artwork for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/simple-steps-to-transform-vitalsource-vbk-books-into-user-friendly-pdf-documents/"><u>Simple Steps to Transform VitalSource VBK Books Into User-Friendly PDF Documents</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/the-art-of-sound-integration-a-detailed-tutorial-on-video-audio-addition/"><u>The Art of Sound Integration A Detailed Tutorial on Video Audio Addition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/the-ultimate-pathway-to-uniform-audio-dynamics-in-three-steps/"><u>The Ultimate Pathway to Uniform Audio Dynamics in Three Steps</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-the-top-8-advanced-speech-recognition-tools-on-various-operating-systems/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Ultimate Guide to the Top 8 Advanced Speech-Recognition Tools on Various Operating Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-top-10-premium-free-audio-streaming-apps-ios-and-android-edition/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Top 10 Premium-Free Audio Streaming Apps IOS & Android Edition</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975841/19272" target="_top" id="1975841">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975841" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975841/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Windows Movie Maker lets you mute audio in just a few steps, so let’s see how you can mute videos with this video editor.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> In order to start editing a video, you must first import it into Windows Movie Maker. Click on the <strong>Add Videos and Photos</strong> icon in the software’s <strong>Home tab</strong> and proceed to select the clip you’d like to mute.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-interface.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><p> Click on the <strong>Open</strong> button in the Add Videos and Photos window and your clip will be imported into the software.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After you added a clip to the storyboard you can preview it in order to decide which parts of the video you’d like to mute. Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> menu in the software’s ribbon, to gain access to the video editing tools Windows Movie Maker has to offer.</p><p> If you would like to mute only a portion of a video clip, you should position the playhead on the storyline at the exact location in the video where you want to make the cut and then click on the <strong>Split</strong> button.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Make sure that the clip you want to mute is selected and click on the <strong>Video Volume icon</strong> on the left side of the Edit tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mute-video-audio-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><p> Drag the slider all the way to the left to mute the audio. Click the <strong>Play button</strong> in the preview window to make sure that video’s sound is muted.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Adding-a-New-Audio-Clip-to-a-Video"><a href="#Part-2-Adding-a-New-Audio-Clip-to-a-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Adding a New Audio Clip to a Video"></a>Part 2: Adding a New Audio Clip to a Video</h2><p> Windows Movie Maker also lets you replace the existing audio clip with a new one. Once again, this process is easy and it can be completed in a few steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> After you’ve muted the audio, click on the <strong>Add Music icon,</strong> that is located next to the Add Photos and Videos icon in the Home tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-windows-movie-maker.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><p> A drop-down menu will appear offering you to select music from an online source or to import an audio file from your computer. Moreover, you can select the starting point of the song you’re importing so you don’t have to adjust the position of the audio file in your project manually.</p><p> In order to do this, you just have to position the playhead at the desired location and select the <strong>Add music at the current point</strong> option from the drop-down menu. You can change the position of the audio file by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard. Using MP3 or WMA audio file is recommended since other audio file formats may not be compatible with Windows Movie maker.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> The audio file you imported will be automatically added to the video clip on the Storyboard. Click Play in the preview window to check if you like the result. Head over to the <strong>File</strong> menu and click on the <strong>Save Movie</strong> option. Windows Movie Maker will offer you a number of different options and if you’d like to save your video to the computer, you should select the <strong>For Computer</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-movie-maker-save.jpg"                      alt=" Windows Movie Maker Audio Editing"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Better-Way-to-Replace-Audio-Files-in-Videos-on-Windows-OS"><a href="#Part-3-Wondershare-Filmora-A-Better-Way-to-Replace-Audio-Files-in-Videos-on-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Wondershare Filmora - A Better Way to Replace Audio Files in Videos on Windows OS"></a>Part 3: Wondershare Filmora - A Better Way to Replace Audio Files in Videos on Windows OS</h2><p> Windows Movie Maker has been discontinued a while ago, and its video and audio editing tools only enable you to perform basic video editing tasks.

You can cut, trim or adjust the start and end position of the audio file or use some of the audio effects the software offers. When done, click on the <strong>Export</strong> button and select the output format that is most suitable for the project you’re working on.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Videos that have poor sound quality won’t impress anyone, but you shouldn’t worry because muting or replacing audio files is a task that requires almost no effort. Windows Movie Maker can be used to quickly mute an audio file, but if you want to have access to more professional audio editing tools using Wondershare Filmora is a much better option.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Master-Your-Computer-Knowledge-with-Top-Insights-From-Tom’s-Hardware"><a href="#Master-Your-Computer-Knowledge-with-Top-Insights-From-Tom’s-Hardware" class="headerlink" title="Master Your Computer Knowledge with Top Insights From Tom’s Hardware"></a>Master Your Computer Knowledge with Top Insights From Tom’s Hardware</h2><p>Mini PC specialist Minisforum has launched a new device, claiming several firsts. The new<a class="link"   href="https://www.minisforum.com/page/x7ti/index.html?lang=en" >AtomMan X7 Ti <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> becomes the first in the firm’s AtomMan line, described as a high-end cutting-edge marque by Minisforum. It is also claimed to be the “first Intel Ultra 9 AI Mini PC with a 4-inch Touchscreen.” With the rising popularity of<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cooling/hands-on-lian-lis-lcd-screen-fans-turn-heads-and-are-surprisingly-affordable-but-not-as-configurable-as-id-like" >extra screens in PCs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , integrating one into a compact desktop might be a popular idea.</p><p> Starting from the outside, we see that the AtomMan X7 Ti would be a conventional-looking<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/asus-gets-license-to-make-intel-nucs" >NUC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> -alike apart from two things. Firstly, it features a 4-inch 480p touch display which covers a fair portion of the top panel. Secondly, it comes with a neat stand that angles the display panel into an easy glanceable view. Furthermore, Minisforum has followed some logic by situating a 1080p<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/windows-hello-fido2-certification-may-update-microsoft,39261.html" >Windows Hello <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> compatible webcam and dual mics above the touchscreen, appealing to video conferencing fans.</p><p> While we are considering external features, let’s look at the ports. Despite its compact size (145 x 145 x 49mm), the AtomMan X7 Ti features a decent quantity and selection of ports, as follows: RJ45 5G Ethernet Port ×2, DP 2.0, HDMI 2.1,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/worlds-first-oculink-usb-4-egpu-with-radeor-rx-7600m-xt" >OCulink <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> Port (up to 64Gbps), USB4 ×2, USB3.2 Gen2 Type-A ×2, USB3.2 Gen1 Type-A, USB2.0, a 3.5mm Combo Jack, SD Card slot, and a Power Button with an embedded fingerprint reader. <a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/wi-fi-7-faq" >Wi-Fi 7 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and Bluetooth 5.4 complement the dual Ethernet ports. It must also be noted that the mix of dedicated monitor and USB4 ports means you can connect up to four external displays to this machine.</p><p> Image 1 of 3</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="Minisforum AtomMan X7 Ti PC"                ></p><p> (Image credit: Minisforum)</p><p> Moving inside, the star of the show is the new Intel Core Ultra 9 processor<a class="link"   href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236849/intel-core-ultra-9-processor-185h-24m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz/specifications.html" >185H <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a 16C&#x2F;22T CPU running at up to 5.1 GHz, and onboard Arc GPU with eight Xe cores running at up to 2.35 GHz.

It uses standard DDR5-5600 SO-DIMMs, up to a max of 64GB. There are also two M.2 2280 PCIe 4.0 SSD slots, and the aforementioned wireless functionality comes courtesy of a socketed Intel BE200 card, so it can be changed for repair or upgrade.</p><p> We don’t have pricing for the AtomMan X7 Ti. Minisforum says it will go on pre-sale from May 20, so we expect to hear more about pricing and shipping RAM&#x2F;storage configurations at that time. Those particularly interested in this product can sign up for an email about it and get a $30 coupon from Minisforum.</p><p> We caught a first glimpse of the AtomMan X7 Ti<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/desktops/mini-pcs/minisforum-first-intel-core-ultra-mini-pc-amd-rx-7600M-xt-mini-pc" >at CES 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> when it was showcased with other interesting new computers like the Minisforum HX200G, Mini Workstation MS-01, and the<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tablets/minisforum-v3-tablet-arrives-the-worlds-first-amd-ryzen-7-8840u-powered-surface-clone" >V3 tablet <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://fox-direct.techidaily.com/new-seamless-audio-visual-synchronization-in-premiere-pro-for-2024/"><u>[New] Seamless Audio-Visual Synchronization in Premiere Pro for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-the-ultimate-playbook-top-20-best-practices-for-maximizing-facebook-video-success/"><u>[New] The Ultimate Playbook Top 20 Best Practices for Maximizing Facebook Video Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-install.techidaily.com/effortlessly-install-3dconnexion-drivers-on-pc/"><u>Effortlessly Install 3Dconnexion Drivers on PC</u></a></li><li><a href="https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-oppo-reno-10-pro-5g-pattern-lock-removal-tools-remove-android-pattern-lock-without-losing-data-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Best Oppo Reno 10 Pro 5G Pattern Lock Removal Tools Remove Android Pattern Lock Without Losing Data</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-after-effects-text-presets/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 After Effects Text Presets</u></a></li><li><a href="https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-wondering-the-best-alternative-to-hola-on-apple-iphone-se-here-is-the-answer-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/"><u>In 2024, Wondering the Best Alternative to Hola On Apple iPhone SE?

While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.</p><p>Step 2. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won’t move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip’s end.</p><p>Step 3. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.</p><h4 id="Split-an-Audio-Clip"><a href="#Split-an-Audio-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Split an Audio Clip"></a>Split an Audio Clip</h4><p>There are around two options to split audio clips in iMovie. You can remove unwanted parts or adjust each section’s duration, volume, or speed while you split a clip.</p><p>Step 1. With your launched project in the timeline, scroll the timeline to the playhead’s position where you want to split the audio.</p><p>Step 2. Click the audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p><p>Step 3.

When the project is open in the timeline, select a video clip and display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p><p>Step 2. Tap the <strong>Actions</strong> button, then tap <strong>Detach</strong>.</p><p>Step 3. A new blue-colored audio clip will then appear below the video project.

Ducking lowers the background music clips’ volume whenever there’s a video clip whose sound is playing simultaneously.</p><p>You can select which audio clips are in the foreground or the background.</p><p>Step 1. Select the timeline’s audio clip to display the inspector at the screen’s bottom.</p><p>Step 2.

This tiny device (via<a class="link"   href="https://liliputing.com/onexplayer-m1-is-a-mini-pc-with-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-oculink-and-usb4/" >Liliputing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) has the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to 32 GB of RAM. It also has an RJ45 port, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2, meaning you have three different connectivity options.</p><p> This tiny device has a 200 mm x 120 mm footprint, making it highly portable—it’s so small that you can fit it inside a relatively loose pocket. It also weighs 600 grams, so you don’t have to worry about hurting your back if you want to move your mini-PC.</p><p> However, this small size means that the mini-PC has only limited slots. It can only accommodate a single M.2 2280 SSD and one SODIMM slot so you can say goodbye to the advantages of dual-channel memory.</p><p> Nevertheless, the OneXPlayer M1 does not lack physical ports to connect your devices. It has two USB4 Type-C ports, one USB 3.2 and one USB 2.0 Type-A port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, an RJ45 ethernet jack, a 3.5 mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outlet, and a microSD card reader. More importantly, it also comes with an OCuLink port to give you the option to provide it with the graphical oomph of the OneXGPU eGPU.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Image 1 of 5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p> Aside from the Power button, One-Netbook also gave its mini-PC an RGB button to adjust the RGB lights on the case. But what’s interesting is that the Turbo button from PCs in the 1980s and 1990s is returning on the OneXPlayer M1. The Turbo button will push the 185H’s power draw from the base 45 to 60 watts — just five watts short of its maximum configurable TDP. A 100-watt USB-C power supply also powers the mini-PC, so you’ll have ample power, even pushing the processor to its limit.</p><p> The OneXPlayer M1 has almost the same shape and size as the OneXGPU, with the external GPU weighing about 250 grams heavier. The latter also features several ports, including two HDMI ports, two DisplayPort outlets, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a USB4 Type-C port with 100 watts reverse power delivery, and a gigabit RJ45 port. This makes both devices perfect for each other, allowing you to get a fully featured computer you could put in two pockets.</p><p> Pre-orders for a 32 GB RAM &#x2F; 1 TB SSD OneXPlayer M1 are already in Japan at JPY142,310 (or around $900). But if you bundle it with the OneXGPU, you get a 10% discount on the eGPU. So, if you’re looking for a small PC you can quickly move around but don’t sacrifice performance and graphical power, you should watch out for the OneXPlayer M1 mini-PC.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp;

From college lectures and audible notes to project meetings, interviews, etc. a large amount of information is being shared through audios. But audio files make it hard to access the information whenever you choose as it can be buried in hours of recordings.</p><p>So there is a need to convert these audios into texts. Texts are easy to access and it is also possible to selectively choose the information you need whenever you need it.</p><p>But you might be worrying about how to convert hours of recordings to texts. Don’t worry, due to the advancement of technology, there are now a lot of applications available to us that can <strong>transcribe audio to text</strong> free.</p><h2 id="How-to-Transcribe-Audio-to-Text-Free-on-Android-and-iOS-1"><a href="#How-to-Transcribe-Audio-to-Text-Free-on-Android-and-iOS-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android and iOS"></a>How to Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android and iOS</h2><p>Most people receive or record audio files on their mobile phones. From students to businessmen, the mobile phone is like a central hub that sends, receives, and stores information, including large audio files. So let’s have a look at how to convert audio to text on both android and iOS devices.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><h3 id="Transcribe-Audio-to-Text-Free-on-Android"><a href="#Transcribe-Audio-to-Text-Free-on-Android" class="headerlink" title="#Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android"></a>#Transcribe Audio to Text Free on Android</h3><p>To convert audio to text on an android device, one of the best options is to use the <a class="link"   href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.speechnotes.speechnotes&hl=en&gl=US" >Speechnotes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> application.

This application will allow you to dictate, translate and transcribe any texts instead of typing them. All most of all texting applications can be configured to operate with dictation which can be a big saver for you during your busy times.</p><p>Some of the features of dictation include 40 dictation and translation languages, audio recording, conversion of recorded files, synchronization with iCloud, easy sharing, etc.</p><p>Let’s have a look at how to transcribe audio to text using the Dictation app:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-transcribe-audio-to-text.jpg"                      alt="transcribe audio to text"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the Dictation application on your Apple store and download it.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After the installation, open the application.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Hit the Dictate Button at the bottom to start recording and speak what needs to be recorded.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After recording hit the same Dictate Button to stop.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the Copy tab to copy the text that has been converted or hit on the Send tab to share it via any messaging application.</p><hr><p>In this busy world where everything is happening fast, it is very important to keep up. Nowadays, everyone in different instances tends to share information in the form of voice messages. Be it long lectures, product information, briefings, etc. voice recordings are shared very much across the world.</p><p>But it is difficult to retrieve information from long audio and hence there is a need to convert audio to text. It is much easier to access information if it’s available in text form rather than audio form. It also enables us to selectively access and marks the needed information. Applications like Speechnotes and dictation allow us to record and convert audio to texts. These applications help us to save time for typing as well as in accessing the information later. So if you are having a problem dealing with audio and need to convert audio to text, check out the apps we have suggested above.
