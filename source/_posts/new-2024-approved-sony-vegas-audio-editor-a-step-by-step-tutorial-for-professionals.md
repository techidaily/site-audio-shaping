* Manage volume control for all events of loaded track: Use Volume Slider switch that is denoted by dB.
* Pan Slider: It is possible to make adjustments for audio pan using a slider named as Center. Users can slide it to left side or right side as per audio project requirements.

**Note:**

1\. Put on your headphone to better verify the output result.

2\. To reset the volume, just double click on the options.

Those who want to control volume separately for different portions of audio file can go to **Audio Envelop** (go Insert > Audio Envelopes)and then make all essential settings as:

**Mute:** A blue line is visible on timeline at your selected audio event, simply double click over it for addition of a specific point and then right click for mute adjustments. From appeared drop down menu you can select muted or not muted and the adjustments will be effective on right side of event point.

#### Section 2: Fade in and Fade Out

Some professional settings to audio project can be made using fade in/out options. Users can pull the fade adjust curser to any direction for easy customization.

Hover your cursor on the audio event in timeline, you will find the fade in/out offset handle at the up side corner of the audio event. Pull the Fade in/out offset handle as long as you want:

#### Section 5: Noise Removal

One classic feature of Vegas Pro is its Sound Restoration in Audio FX control. But it does not work as good compared to Audacity. Check this article to [see how to remove noise from audio](http://www.technospot.net/blogs/remove-background-noise-sony-vegas-audacity/)using Sony Vegas Pro & Audacity.

#### Section 6: Apply unique Audio Effects

If you want to add specific effects to your audio files then use two simple methods on Vegas Pro with its Audio FX tool: One is to add effects on entire video file and second option is to make changes to specific layers of audio project. Use these steps to achieve great results:

**To entire audio layer**

**To an individual portion of the audio layer**
