#### Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration

Step 1\. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.

Step 2\. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won't move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip's end.

Step 3\. Tap outside the audio clip and let the trim handles disappear.

This latest software tool also assists users with easy video editing tricks and the intuitive interface that best serves quality editing to beginners and professionals.

Moreover, you can enjoy royalty-free music tracks for different themes, such as Young and Bright, Tender and Sentimental, Rock, Folk, Electronic Rock, and Hipster Folk, for selection.

All this will be available with a single program called Wondershare Filmora to take advantage of them for free. You do not have to search the background music files like a needle in a haystack.

The audio library has categorized into: YOUNG & BRIGHT, TENDER & SENTIMENTAL, ROCK, FOLK, and ELECTRONIC. The different kinds of sound effects are also available under the **Sound Effects** tab.

Once you find a sound effect or a song, either right-click on it and go with the **Apply** or drag and drop it into an audio track in the timeline.

#### Adjust Audio Settings

Double click on the audio clip to make adjustments to your audio. Open a panel with adjustment sliders in the timeline for pitch and volume.

Another element that you'll find in this panel is **Denoise**, which is a feature that can remove background noise from your audio clips.

For a more professional audio editing experience, you can also access the **Audio Equalizer** from this panel. Select from presets or make manual adjustments by hitting the **Customize** tab.

Play it when you are done and, if you're not happy with the results, tap the **Reset** button to start over.

## Part 3: iMovie Audio Editing Tips & Tricks

iMovie is a great video editor for Mac computers. After understanding the best alternative of **iMovie sound editin** **g**, let's check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.

The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.

So, here we go!

### 1\. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear

To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.

You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can't be seen, go to the **View** drop-down menu and choose **the** **Show** **Waveforms** option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.

The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.

### 2\. Audio Adjustments

With the help of **Adjust** tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip's volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.

The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.

### 3\. Edit Audio with the Timeline

iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain **Fade In** and **Fade Out** tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade's length.

By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.

### 4\. Detach the Audio

By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.

For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the **Modify** drop-down menu, and hit the **Detach Audio** button. You'll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.

A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio's middle portion while leaving the video intact.

### Conclusion

Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding **iMovie audio editing**and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project's presence.

#### Adjust the Audio Clip’s Duration

Step 1\. While the project is launched in the timeline, tap the audio clip (in blue or purple) or the background music clip you wish to adjust.

Step 2\. Now, you can see the display of yellow trim handles. Drag them either at the end of the clip to the points where you wish the audio to start and end. If a trim handle won't move left or right, it simply indicates there is no additional audio to work with on that clip's end.

This latest software tool also assists users with easy video editing tricks and the intuitive interface that best serves quality editing to beginners and professionals.

And, with its video editing features, you can make a green screen effect, stabilize your video footage, reverse your video clip, and more.

Moreover, you can enjoy royalty-free music tracks for different themes, such as Young and Bright, Tender and Sentimental, Rock, Folk, Electronic Rock, and Hipster Folk, for selection.

The audio library has categorized into: YOUNG & BRIGHT, TENDER & SENTIMENTAL, ROCK, FOLK, and ELECTRONIC. The different kinds of sound effects are also available under the **Sound Effects** tab.

Once you find a sound effect or a song, either right-click on it and go with the **Apply** or drag and drop it into an audio track in the timeline.

#### Split Audio Clips

Choose your audio clip and place the playhead where you want to split it, then right-click on the clip and choose the **Split** tab or click the **Split** icon right above on the toolbar.

#### Adjust Audio Settings

Double click on the audio clip to make adjustments to your audio. Open a panel with adjustment sliders in the timeline for pitch and volume.

Another element that you'll find in this panel is **Denoise**, which is a feature that can remove background noise from your audio clips.

For a more professional audio editing experience, you can also access the **Audio Equalizer** from this panel. Select from presets or make manual adjustments by hitting the **Customize** tab.

Play it when you are done and, if you're not happy with the results, tap the **Reset** button to start over.

Now, hit the **Customize** tab next to the drop-down bar to adjust the **Audio Equalizer** manually. Drag the sliders up or down and make the adjustments until you find their ideal value. Finally, hit **OK** and save your settings.

## Part 3: iMovie Audio Editing Tips & Tricks

iMovie is a great video editor for Mac computers. After understanding the best alternative of **iMovie sound editin** **g**, let's check out some tips on editing audio in iMovie best.

The explanations and screenshots below are for iMovie 10 only. However, the steps are a bit similar to older versions.

So, here we go!

### 1\. Use Waveforms to See What You Hear

To properly edit the audio track in iMovie, you need a good pair of headphones and speakers to hear the sound, but you also need to check the sound.

You can check the sound in iMovie by considering the waveforms on each clip. If the waveforms can't be seen, go to the **View** drop-down menu and choose **the** **Show** **Waveforms** option. The clip size for your project can also adjust to get an even better appearance for each video clip.

The waveforms will display the volume level of a clip and give you a good idea of what sections will require to turn up or down. You can also check how the levels of different clips compare to one another.

### 2\. Audio Adjustments

With the help of **Adjust** tab in the top right, you can access some basic audio editing tools for changing your selected clip's volume or changing the volume of other relative clips in the project.

The adjustment window of audio also provides basic audio equalization and noise reduction tools, along with a range of effects - from echo to robot - that will change the way people in your video sound.

### 3\. Edit Audio with the Timeline

iMovie assists you in adjusting the audio within the clips themselves. Each pin has a volume bar, moving up and down to decrease or increase the audio level. The clips also contain **Fade In** and **Fade Out** tabs at the beginning and end, dragging to adjust the fade's length.

By adding a short fade effect, whether in or out, the sound becomes relatively smoother and less conflicting to the ear when a new clip begins.

### 4\. Detach the Audio

By default, iMovie keeps the video and audio sections of clips together for convenience. Yet, you want to use the video and audio sections of a clip separately sometimes.

For this purpose, choose your clip in the timeline, visit the **Modify** drop-down menu, and hit the **Detach Audio** button. You'll now have two clips - one with the images and another with the sound.

A lot you can do with the detached audio. For instance, you could extend the audio clip to begin before the video plays, or so that it plays for a few seconds even after the video fades out. You could also cut out pieces from the audio's middle portion while leaving the video intact.

### Conclusion

Coming towards the end of the discussion, after understanding **iMovie audio editing**and going through an elaborated alternative of iMovie application, we decided that Wondershare Filmora sounds the best out of it. It allows you to flawlessly edit video and audio files on your desktop, with various inbuilt royalty-free music tracks to select from that can further improve your project's presence.
