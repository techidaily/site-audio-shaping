<p>The Clubhouse’s popularity is increasing day by day, and you might have heard about it by now. Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p>
<p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application. If you are a regular fork who wants to know what’s going down on this exclusive social media platform and what it actually is, then we are here to guide you. Here is what you need to know about Clubhouse.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Clubhouse"><a href="#What-is-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="What is Clubhouse?"></a><strong>What is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clubhouse-drop-in-audio-chat/id1503133294" >Clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></h2><p>In simple words, Clubhouse is a voice-based social media app where people can interact with each other and do discussions on various topics in chatrooms. It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>
<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>
<p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2><p>![ clubhouse-interface1](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> interface2.png)</p>
<p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p>
<p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>
<p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time. This app has a simple interface, and it is easy to use. Once you create an account on this app, then you cannot delete your account, and you have to email the support team to request account deletion.</p>
<h2 id="Who-Uses-Clubhouse"><a href="#Who-Uses-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Clubhouse?"></a><strong>Who Uses Clubhouse?</strong></h2><p>The Clubhouse is getting popular among a lot of big celebrities. If you explore the app, then you may find people like Oprah, Kevin Hart, Drake, Chris Rock, or Ashton Kutcher talking in different rooms. They might be hosting different chats. This is basically the most appealing thing about the Clubhouse. You may get a chance to engage and chat with a lot of famous and popular people. It is one of the best apps out there for networking purposes. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerburg also made their appearances on this app, after which people saw a tremendous increase in its downloads.</p>
<p>Other than celebrities, the exclusivity of Clubhouse makes you feel secure and comfortable. There is a lot to learn, and you can do something productive on your time. There are a lot of experts out there that are teaching people about various things, such as MC Hammer hosts rooms related to cryptocurrencies. There are plenty of other experts from various fields. You can interact with them and ask for answers and solutions to your questions and problems. Most people and celebrities use Clubhouse fearlessly because they know that whatever they say on this application is not going to be a news headline the very next day.</p>
<h2 id="How-To-Join-Clubhouse"><a href="#How-To-Join-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="How To Join Clubhouse?"></a><strong>How To Join Clubhouse?</strong></h2><p><img

<p>If the details mentioned above raised your interest in this application, then you should know that it is not for everyone. If you want to join this app, you have to be invited by someone already a user. If you get an invite from a registered user, you can then extend the invite to four other friends. If you do not get an invite and download the app directly from the Apple app store, they will put you on a waiting list. The Clubhouse CEO has promised that the app is going to open for everyone, eventually even for android users. But, right now, they want to grow their number of users slowly to make arrangements for the bigger number of users and overcome the difficulties that the existing users are facing.</p>
<p>If you want to download this application, then simply go to the apple app store and search for Clubhouse: Drop-in audio chat application. Download and install this application. After that, it will ask you to register. If an already registered user invites you, then you will be able to use this application with its full functionality; otherwise, you can reserve a username, and they will put you on their sweet waiting list.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse’s popularity is increasing day by day, and you might have heard about it by now. Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p>
<p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application.

It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>
<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening.

Make Bird Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>You can make sound effects at your home with everyday objects to add to your film videos through a process called Foley. Here is a guide on how you can do it.</p>

<p><strong>● Room Acoustics:</strong></p>
<p>Room acoustics are vital to capturing good recordings. You need a generally larger room to make room acoustics compared to an average size room for better results. Here we emphasize that your sound should have appropriate height, width, and depth. These attributes make the difference in recording high-quality and low-quality sound effects.</p>
<p>The quality of your recordings using acoustics should not be much of a bother, though, because various easy-to-use software eliminates the excess noise in your recordings and make the quality of your recording as good as you would want. This software includes; intrusions prevalence, sixty-cycle hum, and more.</p>
<p><strong>● Microphone Selection:</strong></p>
<p>Microphone selection is a crucial component in making sound effects during recording. You use sensitive mics for interior scenes to capture subtle nuances make good audio. Here we preferably recommend hyper-cardioid condenser mics.</p>
<p>Consider also placement and closeness of the microphone as they significantly affect the sound effect recorded concerning the sound source. For close-up shots, use closer microphone placement, but if you desire more room sound, put distance between the mic and the sound source.</p>
<p>You can also use the standard mic technique to directly capture a bird sound effect by picking it on a mick. Most of those tones will work fine, but post-production manipulation can create excellent cinematic quality.</p>

Make Bird Sound Effect by Yourself</h3><p>You can make sound effects at your home with everyday objects to add to your film videos through a process called Foley. Here is a guide on how you can do it.</p>
<p>Start down the recording process; we break it into two categories: room acoustics and microphone selection.</p>
<p><strong>● Room Acoustics:</strong></p>
<p>Room acoustics are vital to capturing good recordings. You need a generally larger room to make room acoustics compared to an average size room for better results. Here we emphasize that your sound should have appropriate height, width, and depth. These attributes make the difference in recording high-quality and low-quality sound effects.</p>
<p>The quality of your recordings using acoustics should not be much of a bother, though, because various easy-to-use software eliminates the excess noise in your recordings and make the quality of your recording as good as you would want. This software includes; intrusions prevalence, sixty-cycle hum, and more.</p>
<p><strong>● Microphone Selection:</strong></p>
<p>Microphone selection is a crucial component in making sound effects during recording. You use sensitive mics for interior scenes to capture subtle nuances make good audio. Here we preferably recommend hyper-cardioid condenser mics.</p>
<p>Consider also placement and closeness of the microphone as they significantly affect the sound effect recorded concerning the sound source. For close-up shots, use closer microphone placement, but if you desire more room sound, put distance between the mic and the sound source.</p>
<p>You can also use the standard mic technique to directly capture a bird sound effect by picking it on a mick. Most of those tones will work fine, but post-production manipulation can create excellent cinematic quality.</p>
