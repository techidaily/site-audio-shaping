The features of automatic transcription software products offer vary, which is the reason why checking the software’s list of features is the first thing you need to do while searching for a new automatic transcription software. The accuracy with which a software transcribes audio and video files, the amount of text editing tools it offers, or the number of supported languages are just a few among numerous aspects you have to consider before deciding which automatic transcription software you should get.

You don’t have to worry about the software’s compatibility, as you just need a web browser to use any of the automatic subscription software products we featured in this article. However, if you want to transcribe audio and video files from your Smartphone, you should check if the app is compatible with your device and its operating system.

There are only a handful of automatic transcription software products on the market that can be used free of charge, which is why you need to decide if you want to pay per minute of transcription or get a monthly subscription. So, if you are transcribing hundreds of hours of audio and video content each month, it is more affordable to purchase a monthly subscription while paying per minute of transcription is a better option if you don’t transcribe audio and video files often.
