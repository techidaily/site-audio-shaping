One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.
      * Members are matched by their unique code.
      * On the site, you can video chat with others.
      * You can easily use the site's features.

#### **3\.** [**YouNow**](https://www.younow.com/)

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.
      * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.
      * You can also make friends and send and receive gifts from them

An alternative chat platform, TinyChat, offers chat rooms with video feeds of 12 each.

TinyChat is also a browser-based IM client and can be accessed from a PC, mobile device, or browser. While Omegle does not offer coins or points for unlocking special achievements or increasing your chances of landing in the live directory, it does provide you with a chance to interact with other users. A 500-coin token will also be awarded to you if you promote your room via TinyChat.

Users can have up to three video chats at the same time with these guys, taking social networking to a whole new level. In addition to offering free video chat and video conferencing with your friends, you can also communicate with strangers via FaceFlow. The new feature allows users to create a searchable profile and share their favorite online videos and pictures.

Aside from being simply another webcam chat service, this site is more like the amazing services offered by Skype. There is a one-to-one video chat feature as well as text chat. Furthermore, FaceFlow has released a multiplayer game called Flappy in which you have to team up against someone in order to complete the game.

There are many websites similar to Omegle, but Camsurf has a unique twist - it is wild. If you're trying to have fun, then you should visit this website. CamSurf has consistently delivered the most bizarre video chats we've ever experienced. The CamSurf website itself is straightforward and almost identical to the OmeTV website.

These two have a major difference in the types of people they attract. CamSurf has a vastly wider audience than OmeTV. While some individuals on OmeTV are looking for genuine conversation, on CamSurf, you'll find people looking for genuine chat. It is our top choice for next time.

![chatrad-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrad-poster.png)

This site claims to be a G-rated alternative to chat sites like Chatroulette, and it is quite harsh toward behavior that is not appropriate. People need to act the same in the real world, where they don't run around naked or try to expose themselves all of the time... at least not in my world. Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.

**Features:**

      * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People
      * The chat is moderated 24/7 by an active team of moderators.
      * It offers a very safe environment for people.

#### **8.**[**Bazoocam**](https://bazoocam.org/)

The Bazoocam webcam chat environment is another random digital camera chat site that maintains a high level of cleanliness. Like most of the other websites mentioned, you're paired up with an interloper haphazardly. Press "skip" and move on to the next person if you are unsatisfied with what you see.

As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you're bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music. Try playing a string or wind instrument, and you'll find many people to talk to.

**Features**

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.

Users can have up to three video chats at the same time with these guys, taking social networking to a whole new level. In addition to offering free video chat and video conferencing with your friends, you can also communicate with strangers via FaceFlow. The new feature allows users to create a searchable profile and share their favorite online videos and pictures.

CamSurf has consistently delivered the most bizarre video chats we've ever experienced. The CamSurf website itself is straightforward and almost identical to the OmeTV website.

These two have a major difference in the types of people they attract. CamSurf has a vastly wider audience than OmeTV. While some individuals on OmeTV are looking for genuine conversation, on CamSurf, you'll find people looking for genuine chat. It is our top choice for next time.

This site claims to be a G-rated alternative to chat sites like Chatroulette, and it is quite harsh toward behavior that is not appropriate. People need to act the same in the real world, where they don't run around naked or try to expose themselves all of the time... at least not in my world. Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.

**Features:**

      * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People
      * The chat is moderated 24/7 by an active team of moderators.

#### **8.**[**Bazoocam**](https://bazoocam.org/)

As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you're bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music.

If you want to [add audio to video via your android phone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), check this out.

## Part 1\. How to Add Audio to iMovie on iPhone/iPad?

**Step #1.** In your iMovie project, tap the **ADD MEDIA** (**+** Symbol) button.

**Step #2\.** Then, choose **AUDIO**.

You will now be given three options. Soundtracks, My Music, and Songs in iCloud. Make your choice.

To listen to a soundtrack, tap it. If a soundtrack is muted, press it to download it first, and then hit it again to preview it.

**Step #3\.** To add a soundtrack to your project, hit the **Add Audio** icon next to it. iMovie will automatically insert the music at the beginning of the project and adjust it to match the duration of the project.

**Adding sound effects**

When you add a sound effect, it is linked to the video clip above it in the timeline. When you move the video clip, the sound effect moves with it. This differs from soundtracks, which are separate from the video segments in your production.

Scroll the timeline with your project open until the play head (the white vertical line) appears where you wish to add the sound effect.

To browse the built-in sound effects, press the **Add Media** button, then **Audio**, then **Sound Effects**.

To hear a sound effect, tap it.

Tap the **Add Audio** button next to the sound effect to add it.

**Step #4\.** Adjust the volume of the clip

After you've added sound to your iMovie project, you may change the level of audio clips to achieve the ideal sound mix, or change the level of video clips that have sound. To change the volume of an audio or video clip, select it in the timeline, click the **Volume** button at the bottom of the window, and then drag the slider to raise or decrease the volume. When you completely reduce the volume of a clip, a **Mute** symbol displays on the clip in the timeline.

## Part 2\. How to Add Audio to iMovie on Mac?

iMovie for Mac comes with a library of music and sound clips that you may use in your project. In addition to sound effects such as rain and footsteps, iMovie includes audio clips such as ambiances and jingles.

**Step #1\.** With your project open, go to the top of the browser and select **Audio**, followed by **Sound Effects** in the sidebar on the left. To access the Media Browser, you may need to click the **Media Browser** button.

**Step #2\.** Hover the pointer over a jingle or sound clip in the list to preview it, and then click the play button next to the sound clip. You may also preview a song or sound clip by selecting it, clicking on the waveform at the top of the media browser, and then pressing the Spacebar.

**Step #3\.** Drag jingles or other audio clips to the music well, represented by the musical note icon in the timeline, to create background music for your film. The video clips in the timeline have no effect on the audio in the music well.

**Step #4\.** To add music or sound effects to a video clip, drag it under the video clip until a bar linking the clips appears. When you move the connected video clip, the audio follows.

## Part 3\. How to Add Audio to iMovie from iTunes?

If you want to add songs such as M4P music and Apple Music from iTunes to iMovie but discover that all of the music is protected, all you need is the **Sidify Apple Music Converter**. Sidify Apple Music Converter enables you to download music without quality loss. One of Sidify's distinctive advantages is its ability to remove protection at an extremely quick rate â€“ up to 20 times faster than any other similar program. The software's user interface is straightforward. The program is simple to use even for inexperienced users. In this section, we'll teach you how to add M4P music and Apple Music to an iMovie project as background music.

**What you'll need:**

* A Mac or Windows computer running macOS or Windows OS
* The most recent version of iTunes
* Sidify Apple Music Converter is available
* Sidify Apple Music Converter can now play Apple Music

Launch Sidify Apple Music Converter, click the **+** button, and all the tunes you've downloaded from Apple Music will appear in the adding music window, as seen below. Select the song to be converted and click **OK**.

### Step 1\. Select a file type

A setting window would appear after clicking the setting button or the little gear icon on the upper right of the Sidify interface. You may select an output format such as MP3, M4A, WAV, FLAC, or AIFF, as well as a conversion speed of up to 10X and an output quality of up to 320 Kbps. Furthermore, the output path can be changed if necessary.

### Step 2\. Begin the conversion

Once all of the files have been added to the queue and all of the settings have been completed, click the Convert button.

### Step 3\. Find the best-converted music files for iMovie

Now, on your Mac computer, click the **Menu** button to locate the converted iTunes Music files in the target folder. The music may then be readily added to an iMovie project just like any other standard audio file.

## Part 4\. How to Add Audio to iMovie from Spotify?

Offline playback is possible with a Spotify Premium membership. You may save songs, playlists, or albums to listen to later. The essential element to remember is that Spotify music, whether online or offline, can only be accessed through the Spotify application. To put it another way, you do not have permission to import Spotify music into other third-party software programs. It comes with iMovie and other video editing software.

**Step #1\.** Import music from Spotify into **AudFree**. The AudFree Spotify converter must be compatible with the Spotify app. When you run AudFree program from your computer's desktop, Spotify will immediately load. You may now begin to uncover preferred Spotify tunes to add to iMovie. Import them into AudFree by copying and pasting or dragging and dropping.

**Step #2\.** Set the output format and other preferences for iMovie. MP3, WAV, M4A, and AIFF are all supported by iMovie. You may go to the top menu and select 'Preferences' > 'Convert'. A setting window will appear. You may select one of the iMovie-supported audio formats as the output format in the window. You can also change the output parameters.

**Step #3\.** Spotify tracks may be converted for use in iMovie. To begin the download, click the 'Convert' button in the bottom-right corner of the main screen. AudFree program will download Spotify music to target iMovie files at up to 5X quicker speeds. You should disable your antivirus or firewall to make the converting process more stable.

This is why [**Wondershare Filmora**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the best alternative to iMovie.
