Nature would list voice deepening at the top of her list of requests if she had one. People who use their voices as a source of income, voice actors, and even the everyday person think about reducing the pitch of the sound they make.

Speaking with a deeper voice can help you sound more authoritative or become a better speaker. We have conducted extensive research on this topic, and controlling your breathing is one way to make your voice deeper, but it requires a lot of practice. Likewise, you can project your voice and try various techniques to use when you speak deeply, such as swallowing before you start to speak.

If you want to learn how you can make your voice deeper, then you just landed on the right page. In this article, we will suggest to you some natural tips to make your voice deeper, but it is a very time-consuming process because it needs a lot of practice. There is another method to make your voice sound deeper if you are recording it for videos or any other purpose. There are many software and apps available in the market today that can help you alter your voice and make it sound deeper. This article will show you how you can make your voice deeper using Filmora X.

So, Let's start our article with a basic question.

## **Can You Make Your Voice Deeper?**

Yes, It is possible to make your voice deeper.

It is possible to train your voice for a deep, more attractive sound even though you cannot lower it. According to numerous sources online, you can achieve a lower voice pitch by doing specific exercises. However, experts and physicians have not tested these deep voice exercises, which can lead to long-term harm to your throat.

The best way is to use software like Filmora X because all you need to do is record your voice and leave the rest to the software. Using Filmora X, you can easily edit your voice and adjust the pitch to make it sound deeper.

## **How To Make Your Voice Deeper Naturally?**

**1\. Listen to Yourself**

First of all, you have to think about what you have to work with. Record yourself talking with the app on your phone that records audio. If you do not listen carefully to your voice, you will not know what needs to be fixed.

Take a moment to listen to your voice. Because you're now hearing your voice from an external perspective, it might sound completely different from how you thought it would. You can't always avoid mistakes, but you can learn from them.

Take note of how you sound and accept that this is exactly how you sound. During this exercise, listen carefully as words come out of your mouth, study your pitch, and record your voice so you can review the recording later after you've completed your exercise.

**2\. Relax Your Muscles**

As a consequence of stress, bad posture, and injuries, our muscles are drowning in tension. Our entire lives involve the use of our bodies, which directly affects our muscles and adds a great deal of tension. There are four key areas of our body. If you want to make your voice deeper, then you have to release tension from these four key areas. They include the tongue, jaw, throat, and neck. All these organs play a key role in controlling your voice. So, if you are able to relieve stress from these organs and you are able to relax them, then you can easily make your voice deeper with a little practice.

**3\. Use Your Diaphram**

If you're wondering how to make your voice deeper, you shouldn't use your chest for breathing when we have a whole respiratory system to control. As a rule of thumb, the deeper your voice sounds, the deeper the air you inhale goes. You can direct the air to go just where you want it by adjusting the diaphragm.

As you breathe in, bring your nose to your mouth and push your chest backward while taking deep breaths from your nose. When you exhale, tell yourself your full name as you do so. When you speak, you may feel a vibration. It is now easier for you to produce a deeper voice effect since you have learned how to use your diaphragm.

In the world of professional singing, diaphragmatic breathing is one of the most popular techniques. With it, they can control their voice and position it precisely when they want, to produce deep, low-pitched cries (or even high-pitched cries). When you first start, you won't be able to do it naturally, but you'll be able to do it subconsciously with practice.

**4\. Practice Your Chest Voice**

The magic happens in your chest voice. You can make it sound stronger, deeper, and less nasal with a little control. These exercises will focus on deepening your voice since you're looking for ways to make your voice deeper.

Engage your throat first and then speak normally. You will sound lighter and less confident if you usually speak through your nose, which is not good for a deep voice.

Make a hissing sound while exhaling a deep diaphragmatic breath. Having your voice-controlled right within your lungs will allow you to open up your chest. It would help if you started talking now. You will feel your voice flowing up and out of your mouth via your breath. This is the voice of your chest.

**5\. Hum Like You Mean It**

Humming warms up your voice, making it easier to control. In addition, it unleashes feelings of relaxation throughout your entire body, so your muscles can be relaxed. With Hum, you'll be able to lower your voice pitch, talk deeper, and even make your voice sound deeper in a video. Hold your breath with a deep humming for as long as possible. During this process, your vocal cords will be stretched, and stretched vocal cords always give a voice a deeper tone.

As you breathe in again, point your chin downwards toward your chest. Put your chin up and start humming. Speak now. You will feel intense and deep in your voice.

These are some of the natural ways to make your voice deeper. But the thing is, all of them need a lot of practice, and according to experts, one can also damage his vocal cords when practicing all these techniques. But as we told you earlier, there is an easier way of making your voice deeper which is discussed below.

## For Windows

Since Window doesn't have any voice generator like Siri, it is not possible to get your text converted into the voice from your system's built-in features. To convert the text into voice in Windows, it is necessary to use an external service provider. We know that Siri voice generator is the best text-to-voice converter to use while converting your text to audio. But unfortunately, Apple hasn't introduced any website for their Siri Voice Generator. This makes it difficult for the users of the Windows operating system to convert their text into a voice using Siri. But there is no need to be worried, we are here to help you solve this problem. We have found some of the best text-to-voice converter websites that will provide you with the same experience of Siri and its features. There are multiple websites out there that claim to generate the best Siri voices. But it is difficult to choose the best one from all those platforms. We are going to provide you with the best alternative of Siri that can provide you with the same features and qualities as Siri. One of the best alternatives for Siri is Google text to Speech.

[**Google Text-to-Speech**](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech)

![google-speech-to-text-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/google-speech-to-text-poster.png)

**Price:** Chart Attached

**Language Coverage:** 40+

**Voice Choices:** 220+

There is no doubt in the fact that there is no platform or website that can take place of Siri. But Google's Text-to-Speech service is something worth considering as an alternative to Siri. With its service, Google provides its users with a wide variety of language choices to choose from to fulfill the need of every user, no matter where the user lives. The best thing about Google Text-to-Speech is its extensive range of voice choices. You have more than 220 voices to choose from for your content. There is no need to make all your content sound similar. You can always change the voice of your content to match it with the content type and its audience. Google uses the latest technologies to provide you the customized voices for your brand to stand out from the crowd and make your videos and other content unique and different from others. Google incorporates DeepMind's speech synthesis to provide you with the best and most accurate results. The voice generated by Google can't be differentiated because it sounds like a natural and human-like voice. But the thing that makes it less attractive is its pricing. Unlike Siri for Mac, Google charges its user for using its Text-to-voice service on the basis of characters. But all the astounding features and natural voices of Google text-to-speech makes it worth every penny you spend on it. Google has two packages to be availed, Standard and WaveNet. The WaveNet package contains the voices that are used by Google in its products and service such as Google Search, Google Assistance, and Google Translate.

| **PACKAGE**         | **PRICE**                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Standard Voices** | $4.00/1 Million Characters  |
| **WaveNet Voices**  | $16.00/1 Million Characters |
