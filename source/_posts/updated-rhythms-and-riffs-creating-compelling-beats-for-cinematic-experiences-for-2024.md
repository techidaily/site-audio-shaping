The diversity and abundance in different video editing projects spurs the development of different video editing software. Apart from Wondershare Filmora, here are some of other beat making apps for Smartphones, Mac and PC computers.

#### 1\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) **($299.99)**

Final Cut Pro allows the user to sync the beats to the video in many ways.

The process of adding beats is quite simple. All you have to do is add the music to the timeline. Playback and punch the M key to add a marker on each beat. Then finally lineup the inserted clips.

**Review:** The platform does not allow an automated process for the addition of footage or creating cuts. And the price is not user friendly if you have a tight budget.
