* Create Or Compose Own Sound Effects
* Get From YouTube Sources
* Use Third-Party Sources
* Consider Built-In Features Of Video Editors
* With upcoming details, you will get detailed information about all these methods.

### Method 1: Create Or Compose Own Sound Effects

In some cases, people don’t find the sound effect or audio as they really want or plan to feature in the video. It is the main reason why people start investing more time in research. If you face these types of conditions, you should pick the option of creating your own effects. For all these things, you should have technical knowledge of music, such as – tempo, pitch, and so on. It will help you get the desired results and save lots of time that you may spend searching for the best options.

### Method 2: Get From YouTube Sourc

YouTube has lots of entertaining content, such as – different types of videos. Now, YouTube Audio Library is also available for music lovers. You can consider YouTube for searching for a suitable match. On YouTube, you will get lots of variations regarding sound effects and all. When it comes to dealing with it, you need to be careful and smart. Using YouTube Audio Library is not easy as other sources. Here, you cannot download or use all types of audio files freely.

The users need to be focused on the copyright policy carefully. Some audio files are free from copyright restrictions. In case you find any YouTube video with suitable sound effects, you can use online sources to download and convert it into MP3.

### Method 3: Use Third-Party Sources

In case you are not getting satisfied with the previous two methods, you should be focused on third-party sources. Generally, these specific sources are available in the form of online platforms or websites. These websites are having big audio libraries with different types of sound effects and audio files. The biggest factor about all these things is related to the service type. The users don’t have to spend a single penny on it and are allowed to download the desired content as well.

Here, you should be focused on choosing the best service provider only. You may face some bad or scammer platforms as well. Try to be smart and careful while making a final decision.

## **Record Voice Using Audacity**

Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.

1. First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching "audacity windows 7", "audacity windows 8", "audacity windows 10", or "audacity mac" depending upon the operating system you are using.
2. Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.
3. Now you'll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be 'Windows WASAPI'. From the next choice to the right, choose 'Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)'.
4. It's important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers
5. Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time
6. Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.

## **Final Verdict**

That's how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows/Mac 10's built-in 'Voice Recorder' app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.
