#### 1 Add the AVI file to the program

 To get started using Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor), download and install the program. Open the AVI you wish to edit in this video editing software. You can either drag and drop the file into the program or click “Import”. Then AVI file will appear in the media item near the preview pane.

#### 2 Remove the audio from AVI file

 Then drag the AVI file into the Video Timeline to begin editing. Right click on the file and select "Audio Detach”. The audio will automatically appear on the Audio Timeline. Click on the audio track you wish to delete and press the "Delete" button on your keyboard. Alternately, you could right-click the track and select the "Delete" command.

 Tip: If you want to add a new audio file to the video, just drag-n-drop it to the Audio Timeline. Then double click to edit it in the editing panel. You can change the playing speed, volume, pitch, etc. as you like. You can also hit “Record a voiceover” and plug in your microphone to record your own voice and add it to the video.

#### 3 Save the new file

 After that, press the Create button to save it to a suitable format. The process will take some time depending on the output file length and your computer performance.
