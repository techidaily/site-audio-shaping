## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

## Part 2: Why is Chromebook better at making DAW than iPad

There are many reasons why making DAW on Chrome OS is better than making it on an iPad with Mac OS. Here are a few of the main reasons mentioned below:

### 1\. Reasonably Priced

By comparison to iOS, Chrome OS is an open-source operating system — which ensures a lot of businesses will utilize it to build a wide variety of Chromebooks with infinite pricing choices. On the other side, Chromebooks are sold in a larger and more economical variety. One of the easy computers is available for as low as $149\. Although some special models can have a high price tag, most models will not get more than $300 in price. Often Chromebooks are less expensive than an iPad to repair or replace.

### 2\. Easy Accessibility

The iPad is a 100% touchscreen experience first and foremost. Since Chromebooks are available as notebooks and tablets, whether you've got a trackpad/mouse or a touchscreen, you can connect with them. This additional versatility encourages you to use a Chromebook precisely what you like and often allows using a mouse easier and more effectively for other activities, as are the powerful keyboard shortcuts available for Chrome OS.

## What is Audio Ducking?

Do you wish to go live with beautiful background music, interactive sessions, or a fun party time? Many of you would have heard of this [audio ducking mechanism](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as video creators and audio spectators. But, let me introduce it for better understanding.

Audio ducking is a mechanism where the background audio is ducked anytime or compressed temporally if any dual audio is detected or present.

Beyond live sessions, ducking is in narrations, translations, and podcasts as well.

In technical terms, ducking is a sidechain compression where the secondary audio channel takes control over or compresses another channel. If the control channel threshold exceeds, the audio channel lowers, leaving no trace of background audio, and when the point drops, the background audio levels up again. Such chains or compression is a manual job using signal compressors, portable PAs, and Ui24R.

In technical terms, ducking is a sidechain compression where the secondary audio channel takes control over or compresses another channel. If the control channel threshold exceeds, the audio channel lowers, leaving no trace of background audio, and when the point drops, the background audio levels up again. Such chains or compression is a manual job using signal compressors, portable PAs, and Ui24R.

![google podcast search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg)

The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits.

But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.

Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.

Free and Ad-free Experience

Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google's standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.

Clean UI

In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.

Google Podcast (formerly Google Play Podcast) is Google's proprietary podcast-listening app. It comes pre-installed on some Android smartphones and all Pixel editions. Even Apple users can install Google Podcasts via the App Store. It's free and lets you discover, stream, and download podcasts.

Google Podcast has already hit 100 million downloads, an indication of its rising popularity both among content creators and users. Users prefer it for its navigable, search-aligned, minimalist interface. And prominent podcast creators are focusing on the app to make their episodes accessible to millions of Android users.

## Part 2: Google Podcasts Features

Compatible with Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Blackberry, and ChromeOS, Google Podcast is relatively a novice compared to dedicated podcast services. Still, Google Podcast seamlessly incorporates nearly every feature one needs to listen to podcasts.

Search and Personalized Recommendations

![google podcast search](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-2.jpg)

The most significant feature of Google Podcast is its algorithm-based recommendations that connect users with shows that suit their listening habits. As a new user, you might want to explore new topics and taste new concepts, and that's where Google Podcast will impress you. But even more than that, it will automatically recommend suitable podcasts depending on your interest and previous engagements with the platform.

Google Podcast app covers a plethora of podcasts, so you do not have to switch to other platforms to discover something new or topics you love.

Free and Ad-free Experience

![google podcast ad free](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-3.jpg)

Google Podcast is completely free in a world where podcast platforms demand high charges for an ad-free and high-quality experience. All you need is a Google account to register and listen to anything available on the platform. In addition, podcast creators have to qualify to Google's standards before submitting the podcast on the forum, ensuring you will listen to the podcast in high quality.

Clean UI

![google podcast interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-4.jpg)

Whether you've used a podcast platform before or not, the Google Podcast platform will seem familiar. Once you sign up, the interface will welcome you with podcasts covering all genres arranged neatly in a grid view for convenience.

In line with simplicity, the Settings option in the Google Platform app is as basic as basic gets. Plus, it allows you to conveniently organize your subscriptions and downloads via the Library tab.

One more thing: although Google Podcast is primarily designed for Android users, its counterparts on other OS, like Apple, Web, and macOS, remain simple and easy to use.

Auto-downloads, Sleep Timer, and Seamless Switch Between Devices

![google podcast downloads](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/what-is-google-podcast-app-5.jpg)
