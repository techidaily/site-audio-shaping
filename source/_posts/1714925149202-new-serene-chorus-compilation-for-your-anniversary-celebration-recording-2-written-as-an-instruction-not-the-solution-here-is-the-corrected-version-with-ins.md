## Do and Don'ts When Using Free Video Background

Any video background on your website can reduce website speed, destruct important texts and messages or cause a drop in conversion rate. It’s therefore important to learn where to draw the lines when using background videos.

Here are the best five tips to help use free video backgrounds the right way.

* **Use short video of low bitrate**

To avoid buffering of the video and affecting the speed of your website page negatively, consider using background videos that are 2MB or less. A three-second video is good enough to make a website homepage or video background stunning.

* **Use loopable video background**

Setting your website background video to play in loops is one way of ensuring the video is short. The other preferred option is setting the video background to play continuously. This tends to work better as it does not affect the CPU functionality.

* **Use slow-motion videos**

Fast-moving video backgrounds are destructive and in some cases reduce the content conversion rate. To avoid visitors sticking to the video background for long, reduce the movements.

* **Use compressed background videos**

A compressed video has a low bitrate and therefore plays smoothly without affecting the page load speed. It’s good to compress the video to 720 pixels. Even though high pixel videos are of the best quality, avoid them completely.

* **Use an overlay**

To hide poor quality videos or very bright background videos, use an overlay on top of the video. A semitransparent overlay makes the video more attractive, engaging and creates more interest to look at, as the details are not clearly visible.

## What Is a Video Background?

Video background refers to the motion video clips or animations playing behind foreground content or video. Video backgrounds fall under two categories:

* Real background

They are real people videos, product videos, office videos or a clip of real image videos of physical things like sky, water storm, and animals.

* Fake background

These are computer created animations in motion appearing behind texts on a website landing page or a video. The main used fake background is a green screen.

## Advantages of Using a Video Background on Website/Video

There are many reasons you should use a video background on your website or video. Here are some of the reasons;

* You can use a video background to visually showcase your products
* After an adventure, the best way to share your experience is using your recorded video as a background on your landing page
* To make your website more appealing
* To engage and increase your contents conversion rate
* It’s human to be attracted to anything in motion. For this reason, website experts use motion backgrounds to grab the attention of the readers and hold them on the page for longer.

## Where To Use a Video Background?

Simply because you can download as many free video backgrounds as you want, you cannot use them on every website or video.

For your video background to be of advantage, these are the places to use it:

* Wordpress websites- Wordpress has a video background plugin for website owners.
* PowerPoint- If you love creating PowerPoint presentations, the best option to make presentable is by using a video background.
* YouTube – If you own a YouTube channel, use the best free stock video clips to win more viewership.

## Do and Don'ts When Using Free Video Background

Any video background on your website can reduce website speed, destruct important texts and messages or cause a drop in conversion rate. It’s therefore important to learn where to draw the lines when using background videos.

Here are the best five tips to help use free video backgrounds the right way.

* **Use short video of low bitrate**

To avoid buffering of the video and affecting the speed of your website page negatively, consider using background videos that are 2MB or less. A three-second video is good enough to make a website homepage or video background stunning.

* **Use loopable video background**

Setting your website background video to play in loops is one way of ensuring the video is short. The other preferred option is setting the video background to play continuously. This tends to work better as it does not affect the CPU functionality.

* **Use slow-motion videos**

Fast-moving video backgrounds are destructive and in some cases reduce the content conversion rate. To avoid visitors sticking to the video background for long, reduce the movements.

* **Use compressed background videos**

A compressed video has a low bitrate and therefore plays smoothly without affecting the page load speed. It’s good to compress the video to 720 pixels. Even though high pixel videos are of the best quality, avoid them completely.

* **Use an overlay**

To hide poor quality videos or very bright background videos, use an overlay on top of the video. A semitransparent overlay makes the video more attractive, engaging and creates more interest to look at, as the details are not clearly visible.
