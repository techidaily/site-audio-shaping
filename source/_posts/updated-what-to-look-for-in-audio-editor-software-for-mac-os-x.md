## How to Add Music/Audio to a GIF on Mac?

# How to Add Music/ Audio to a GIF on Mac?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

When you are sending a GIF to your friends or uploading it on social media, you are actually expressing your emotions through it. But would it be better if you could music to your GIF?

GIF or Graphics Interchange Format is an image format that doesn’t support music. It’s because it cannot store audio files and just videos are compatible with a music file. So, does it mean you cannot add music to GIF?

Well, you can. If you **convert the GIF to a video file, you can add music to your GIF**. This is how some GIF posts on social media have audio. Adding music to your GIF will give it more spunk and will make them more entertaining and funnier.

In case you are wondering how to add music to your GIF files, here are a few ways you can try out.

## 1. Kawping

Do you want a cross-platform GIF maker that will help in adding music to your GIF? Kawping might just be the right choice for you. As already discussed, you can only add music to videos and GIF is a kind of image that cannot store audio files. However, with Kawping you can save the GIF in an MP4 format when you import the GIF.
