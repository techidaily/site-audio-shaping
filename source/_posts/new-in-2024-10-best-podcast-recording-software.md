### 6\. [Zencastr](https://zencastr.com/)

**Price:**  Free, pricing plans start at $20,00 per month

**Compatibility:** web-based

Having new guests for each new episode of your podcast can be difficult at times since their schedules can be too busy. Zencastr resolves this issue by enabling its users to conduct interviews online.

You just have to send a link to your guest and this web-based podcast recorder will capture the interview in lossless 16-bit 44.1k quality. Zencastr separates tracks per guest which prevents quality drop-offs throughout the recording. The app’s Soundboard lets you add intros and outros to each new podcast your record in just a few clicks. All interviews you record with Zencastr are edited automatically, so you don’t have to spend time adjusting the file’s audio levels.

### 8\. [ProTools](https://www.avid.com/pro-tools#Choose-your-version)

**Price:**  Pricing plans start at $29,99 per month

**Compatibility:** Windows, macOS

**Pros**

* Enables podcasters to conduct remote interviews
* Efficient call scheduling tools
* The number of calls you can make with Ringr isn’t limited

### 10\. [ecamm Call Recorder for Skype](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)

After the recording session is completed you can choose if you want to export the recording as an MP3 audio file or as an HD video file. The lack of basic audio editing tools, effects or plugins makes ecamm Call Recorder for Skype a poor choice for all podcasters who want to polish the podcasts before sharing them with an online audience. This application for Mac computers can only be a complementary tool that enables podcasters to conduct remote interviews, but it cannot be your only choice if you want to create podcasts on a regular basis.

**Pros**

* Effortless recording session setup
* Lets its users export recordings as audio and video files
* Great for conducting interviews through Skype
* Requires no previous audio recording experience

**Cons**
