## Part 2: Best Music Beat-Making Software Alternatives

The diversity and abundance in different video editing projects spurs the development of different video editing software. Apart from Wondershare Filmora, here are some of other beat making apps for Smartphones, Mac and PC computers.

#### 1\. [Final Cut Pro](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/) **($299.99)**

Final Cut Pro allows the user to sync the beats to the video in many ways. Final Cut Pro does not allow direct addition of the beats but the app works in collaboration with the BeatMark X to help you add the beat markers to the audio you choose as the video soundtrack. This is all done in BeatMark X and then the user is allowed to create XML file then can be then exported to the Final Cut Pro.

The process of adding beats is quite simple. All you have to do is add the music to the timeline. Playback and punch the M key to add a marker on each beat. Then finally lineup the inserted clips.

**Review:** The platform does not allow an automated process for the addition of footage or creating cuts. And the price is not user friendly if you have a tight budget.

#### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html) **($59.99 as a single app)**

Premiere Elements helps simplify the entire video-making process. Adding beats to the video is a simple task here. All you have to do is add the required audio file to the timeline and then make use of the beat detection. This adds markers to the entire track. The beat detection setting can be customized as per the requirement. The customization takes just a few moments.

**Review:** This feature can only be used in the expert view of the app only. The expert view app allows the user to add new markers just by punching the set bead maker option in the timeline.

#### 3\. [Splice](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725) **(Free, but offers in-app purchases)**
