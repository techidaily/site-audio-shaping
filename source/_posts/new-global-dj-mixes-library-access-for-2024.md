### Streaming Platforms

Many sites have enormous libraries for DJs to create DJ background music. But today, these are replaced by the most fantastic streaming services like Spotify and Apple music.

You can hunt for DJ songs on these, but you'll have to download the files from another service if you do not have a compatible DJ programme. But these days, even these platforms are finding their way into DJ software.

The easier and best way is to explore the playlists that already exist on these apps. This way, you can discover new songs for DJ's based on the listening trends of the audience.

For example, apple music has playlists for nearly every genre, allowing you to keep updated with the latest tunes. Spotify's daily playlists are genre-based, and a fantastic blend of previously listened to songs and new tracks to compliment!

You may land up on new genres and impressive tracks in the process. This way, you can expand your search for good tracks. If you expose yourself to the digital radio on Apple Music or Spotify, you might find fantastic party sounds to add to your collection.

Independent and undiscovered artists sometimes offer their songs to use for free. Some established artists and labels also give out some freebies. If you have these resources up your sleeve, you won't have to worry about your budget. Take a look ahead at some of these below-
