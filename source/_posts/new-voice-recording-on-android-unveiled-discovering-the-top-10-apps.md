Then drag and drop the music files to the track above the video track. Now you can trim it and adjust the position to fit for your video length.

You have created a video with amazing transitions, titles, slides etc. but, the action in the video still missing? If yes, then you need to focus on the sound effects. MP3 cat sound effects are best to make your video more effective and attractive as well.

Audio is vital as it connects audiences. Further, the audio raises the entertainment value, elicits emotions, and set the mood. When used correctly, dialogue, audio effects, music, or even silence can drastically improve your movie.

An excellent audio effect can make or break your video. There can also be challenges to finding good sources for sound effects. There are many websites offering royalty-free sound effects which can be easily downloaded.

Let's look at where you can find cat sound effects in the mp3 format.

## Part 1 Websites That Offer Free Sound Effects

Several websites provide free cat sound effects which can be downloaded quickly. Each website has a diverse range of genres, styles, and sounds to choose from.

There are two ways you can go about this. One is by using free sound effects and the other using paid software. Remember, the type of licensure limits free sound effects.

![cat sound effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/cat-sound-effect.png)

Here are a few options for getting free cat sound effects:

### Adobe Audition Sound Effects

Sound effects in Adobe Audition add sophisticated richness to your audio compositions. You can choose from numerous free cat sound effects for everything where soundtracks are essential.

It allows you to add new sounds, emotions, and a dash of humor to your projects. Like adding a cat sound effect to your video!

### FreeSound

This website is a database of over 400,000 sound effects available for free download. With an old school website and easy navigation layout.

Remember, not all their sound effects can be used commercially. A few nonscript names, making it challenging to find the right sound.

### SoundBible

It is an easy-to-use program for sound effects. You can begin downloading the royalty-free audio effect clips users see as soon as it arrives at the site's top page. Every clip's license is prominently illustrated next to it, and there are thousands of them.

You can request a sound from the community if you can't locate it on SoundBible, a fantastic feature. The only criticism is that browsing for audio is a little cumbersome, and the site design needs a little patience for navigating.

Aside from that, this is a fantastic site, and the community that promotes it deserves recognition.

### YouTube

It offers creators an audio library for cat sound effects and other effects too. They are available at the Creator Studio. Once you enter the creator studio, select "Other Features" to find the audio library.

You can find many royalty-free sound effects and music. The sound effects tab allows users to sort by "most popular" and featured music.

Alternatively, you can filter using "Category" and sort through to find the cat sound effects.

Let's look at a few options to create the cat sound effects!

![cat sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/cat-sound.png)

### Option 1: YouTube

You can download a Cat Sound Effect from the YouTube search bar. In order to download the video, you can copy the link and use a YouTube specific video downloading website online.

This website allows users to select the format of the output file. With this, it has never been easier to download videos for either personal views or to convert to audio.

It's easy to convert a video to an audio file. There are online websites that allow users to convert cat sound effect videos into an mp3 file.

Another way to level up the audio file’s quality is by choosing the highest bitrate. Bitrates from audio can be anywhere from 96 bitrates to 320 bitrates.

Convert the file with a higher bitrate for better quality. Then embed the audio for its intended use.

### Option 2: Wondershare Filmora

A slightly more accessible option is to use Wondershare's Filmora, a video editor with powerful and versatile options to create videos like cinematic masterpieces.
