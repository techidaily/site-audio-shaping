### 2\. How do you edit sound on TikTok?

If you choose the scissors symbol with your finger, you'll see a waveform emerge at the bottom of the screen. You may go to the song segment you wish to hear using your finger. From that location, you can see the song's time stamps. You may also control the volume of the sound by using the option "Volume," located at the very bottom of the screen.

### 3\. How do I repair a video muted on TikTok?

In case TikTok muted your video for any reason, you try these two options:

1. Delete the video, reupload it to TikTok, and then add sound to it while editing it so the video may get played. After that, reduce the sound level until it reaches zero, and you will be able to submit the video. You can include any sound in the video.
2. Ensure you do not reupload the exact video. You can use an external video editing tool like Filmora to add effects and cut the video into shorter clips. Once done, try reuploading the video and follow the TikTok guidelines this time.

Adding a sound to your video and lowering the level of that sound to zero is one way to prevent your video from being removed for violating copyright laws.

## Conclusion

Thus, this tutorial covered **how to mute your TikTok audio** before and after you publish a video. You can instantly alter the level of the music already on the device or any additional sounds by using the built-in Sound function. Besides, we also listed the best tool, Filmora, via which you can generate silent movies for the social platform. In short, if a sound isn't available on TikTok, you can get past TikTok's limited library by producing your film using an additional editing tool like Filmora. This program also guides you on **how to mute original audio in TikTok**. It will help if you either get stuck composing your music or use the already available sounds on TikTok.
