You have a video that includes a great soundtrack that you'd like to **extract** it so that you can listen to it using the media player - a portable MP3 player, for instance. That can be a very easy job if you use the professional video editing software- [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Just follow this guide to **extract audio from video** with ease.

**_If you didn't have Filmora yet, click the download button below to get started._**

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Import video files

Install and run this Wondershare Filmora. Then click the “Import” button to locate and add your target video. You can also directly drag and drop the video to the program. The loaded video will be listed in the media library as the following picture shows.

![extract audio from video - import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/extract-audio-from-video-filmora9-media-library.jpg)

#### 2. Start extracting audio from video

![extract audio from video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/detach-audio-filmora9.jpg)

After importing video to Wondershare Filmora, drag the video from the media library to the video Timeline. You can then right-click the video clip and choose “Audio Detach” to extract audio from the video. After a while, video and audio will be displayed on different tracks. If you don’t want to keep the video file, right-click it and choose “Delete” to remove it from the video timeline.

#### 3. Edit the extracted audio if you like

Double click the extracted file in the audio track and then you will see the audio editing panel.

You can add fade-in and fade-out effects, [change the sound volume](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), adjust the pitch to [change the voice](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), etc. as you like.

![edit extracted audio from video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

If you find some unnecessary sounds in the extracted audio file, and you want to delete them, just put the cursor to the place where you would like the deletion to start and press the “Split” button to split. The end of the deletion area can be marked similarly – play the audio and select the final point of the area to be excluded from the output audio, and then press the “Split” button again.

#### 4. Save the edited audio file
