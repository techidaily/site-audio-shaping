![add transitions classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-9.jpg)

Step 13: Your wedding invitation is almost ready. All you need to add is classical background music. For that, you can search the music from the audio tab or choose from the above-mentioned options. Also, you can import music from your computer to use in the video
