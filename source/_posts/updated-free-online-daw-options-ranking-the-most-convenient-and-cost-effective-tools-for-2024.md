You can use it to mix audios and adjust the volumes of the individual tracks as per your needs and wants.

Music Editor can help you reverse the audio and play it backward. In addition to this, it has a built-in compressor if needed to compress any audio file. Your edited files are saved in the application, so in case you want to re-edit, share or delete, it can be done with ease.
