Step 2: After the part has been identified, let's move further and head to the Effects tab. From the submenu, hover on the Noise Reduction/ Restoration option. Now, select the Capture Noise Print option; this feature finds all the highlighted part information.

Step 3: Next step demands you to open the Effects tab. Once that is done, go to the Noise Reduction / Restoration option. Further, select the Noise Reduction Process.

Step 4: This will open a pop-up window for Noise Reduction Control where you can adjust things. This Adobe voice editor allows you to adjust Noise reduction by using the slider. For detailed editing, open Advanced options like Smoothing, etc.
