### Audio Extraction Process

The audio extraction procedure is a great way to lubricate the editing process. The audio is extracted to add new audio master clips in this phenomenon. The channel mapping, duration, gain, speed, and footage adjustment are applied to the extracted clips. The original content remains preserved.

Before detaching audio, let us shift our focus to extracting it. So, are you with us? Follow the step-by-step below to extract audio from the video.

Step 1: Launching Premiere Pro

Open Adobe Premiere Pro. Press 'New Project' from the interface that appears. The default settings are good to go. However, make sure that the output location is appropriate. Hit 'OK.'
