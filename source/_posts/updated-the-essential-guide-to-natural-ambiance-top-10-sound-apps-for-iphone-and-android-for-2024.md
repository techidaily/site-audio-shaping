The advancements in AI technology have made noise reduction seamless. Although, there are some pre-recording measures one can take to minimize noise. This section on **reducing background noise in iMovie** will mention those measures. The following primary considerations can make a big difference in terms of noise:

### 1\. Pick the Right Location

If you are recording an audio or video, the first step is to choose the right surroundings. Although no location can be completely noise-free, one can try. Places with less population and more nature are noise-free as usual. Book a studio for video or audio recording, as you don't need much effort. They offer pre-arranged setups and space, which also includes noise-canceling equipment.

### Exclusive Sound Editing Features of Wondershare Filmora

Wondershare Filmora brings its users an extensive range of audio and video editing features. There is so much one can do with their hands on this software. This section of the article will discuss other audio-relative features of Filmora:

### 1\. [AI Audio Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

There are multiple forms of background noises and techniques to remove them. Filmora's denoise features provide multiple techniques for denoising. Users can employ its audio enhancement feature to improve speech. Moreover, it has wind removal, hiss, and hum removing options. You can also employ its reverb reduction to minimize echo in your content.

### 2\. [Silence Detection](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

One of the many ways of uplifting your content’s audio is to remove the silent pauses. Locating and eliminating silent parts of video is difficult by yourself. This AI auto-detects and eliminates the silent parts of videos with precision. It will optimize your videos for the audience, as the pauses may irritate them.

### 3\. [Audio Ducking](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Being a content creator can be challenging in terms of precise editing. In Filmora, you do not need to adjust the audio elements of each track separately. With its audio ducking feature, users can fade one audio track to clarify the other. It auto-detects the speech parts of videos and decreases the music levels in them.

### 4\. [Auto Beat Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If you wish to align your video footage with an external audio track, this is the best option. Filmora's audio beat sync streamlines your content with its functionality. Its Auto Montage Maker synchronizes content and adds effects according to beat points. Moreover, it can auto-enhance your content by fixing the overexposed or dark portions.

### Using AI Vocal Remover in Wondershare Filmora

After familiarizing yourself with a few of Filmora’s functionalities, let’s discuss further. This section of our article will guide you about accessing vocal remover. Follow the guide mentioned below to remove vocals from your video:
