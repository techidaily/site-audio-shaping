<p>Most of us have playlists made up of songs that have been either chart-toppers or have gone viral or are immensely popular. But now and then, we come across some obscure and underrated song that suits our music taste. The song might be in a different language or from a foreign country.</p>
<p>We want to find those songs to put on our playlist, but we do not have enough information about them. What do you do? Just use a song identifier online service to look up the song name so that you can listen to your new favorite music again – whenever you want!</p>

<p>However, as the production grows and needs large-scale filming, more specific members are needed for different departments. Whether you want to set up a filming studio, or join a movie-making workshop, you’d better figure out the entire composition of the film crew and choose the best one according to your capabilities.</p>
<p>To simplify the scenario, we have divided the crew into these major departments, as shown below, with their work areas.</p>
