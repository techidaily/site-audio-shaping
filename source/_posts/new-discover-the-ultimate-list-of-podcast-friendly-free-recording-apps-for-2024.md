**Price:**  Free, pricing plans start at $20,00 per month

### 10\. [ecamm Call Recorder for Skype](https://www.ecamm.com/mac/callrecorder/)

**Price:**  $39,95

**Compatibility:** macOS

ecamm Call Recorder for Skype is not a podcast recording software product, as it is primarily used as a tool that [records Skype conversations](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

* Great for conducting interviews through Skype
* Requires no previous audio recording experience

**Cons**
