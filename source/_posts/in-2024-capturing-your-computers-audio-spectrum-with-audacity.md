## **Record Voice Using Audacity**

Although you can record the computer audio using built-in tools, many 3rd party tools like Audacity provide you with more features and better quality than the built-in tools. To use Audacity for recording your pc audio, follow the steps given below.

1. First of all, you need to download the audacity software to your pc. Different versions of Audacity are available for different operating systems. So, you can try searching "audacity windows 7", "audacity windows 8", "audacity windows 10", or "audacity mac" depending upon the operating system you are using.
2. Once it is installed, run the software, and its interface will appear on your screen.
3. Now you'll need to customize the drop-down boxes above the timeline. The farthest thing on the left should be 'Windows WASAPI'. From the next choice to the right, choose 'Speakers (Realtek(R) Audio) (loopback)'.
4. It's important to set the Recording Channel to 2 (Stereo). Otherwise, an error message will likely appear. Verify that the output device is set to the appropriate speakers
5. Once you have finished, click the red circle on top of your screen, and Audacity will record the audio that comes out of your speakers. If no audio is detected, the recording will be automatically paused. You can also stop by hitting the grey stop button at the top at any time
6. Audio editing tools like Audacity allow you to edit your recording after recording it and export it in several formats based on what you recorded.

## **Final Verdict**

That's how it works. Here are two easy ways to record the audio coming from your PC. Record internal audio (such as what comes out of your microphone) with Windows/Mac 10's built-in 'Voice Recorder' app or Audacity. These applications are both extremely simple to use. To get the best audio quality, we recommend trying our Filmora Audio tools. Although Audacity does the job pretty well with filmora audio tools and voice packs, you can add many voice effects and edit your audio professionally. Give it a try as it is free to use.

## **Part 1\.** **How to Remove Echo from Audio in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/): A Step-by-Step Guide**

Echo in your audio can occur for many reasons. You could be recording a podcast in different locations and working from a home studio.

### [**AI Vocal Remover**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

For you to remove echo from your audio files with Filmora, you will need to utilize the AI Vocal Remover feature. The feature is specially designed to separate vocals and music from any song. However, it also allows you to remove other audio elements from your soundtrack, including echoes and wind. You only need to optimize your preferences, and the feature will handle the rest. Here are the few simple steps you will need to follow:

#### **Step 1: Launch Filmora and Create a New Project**

First of all, start the Filmora software on your desktop. Then click the “New Project” tab. This will open the Filmora editing space.
