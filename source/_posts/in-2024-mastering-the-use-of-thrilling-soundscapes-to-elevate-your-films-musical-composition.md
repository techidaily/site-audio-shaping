## Part 1: How Does Suspense Music Work in Film?

It is crucial to understand how suspense music works in the film, especially for beginners. Most movie makers do not know how to build the tension and drop it. The carefully planned dynamics are your way to great mystery output.

The dynamics of the intense music are used to lower the volume and then burst out the music and reveal the big secret. A perfect balance between tension and revulsion creates a more powerful storyline and impacts the audience.

The first factor, tension, is always built slowly and steadily. The suspense background music is deployed in such a situation. Revulsion, on the other hand, is the next moment. It is when the monster is out of the closet. It is the revelation of the big secret of the movie. If tension is the suspenseful music, the revulsion is where horror music comes over.

The right balance between the two soundtracks will mark the success of your upcoming thriller. If the tension lasts longer, the audience breaks it on their own. It often occurs through a joke or breaking silence. Similarly, if the revulsion cues in soon, there is not enough time to build the fear.

For instance, the Main Theme from "Gravity" establishes volume and tension until the movie's climax is reached. Similarly, "Braveheart" uses extensive crescendos to create an intense thriller aura. Most directors always use dissonance to establish a hype. The film "Planet of the Apes" used a mix of soothing and disturbing tones to make the audience uncomfortable.

In such a situation, you can use metal scraping with creepy laughter. The process will be concluded with a hint of echo and reverb for a scary vibe. The sound design is yet another way to build fear. The video game known as "Fall Out" used echoing music to leave a creepy impression.

## Part 2: Tips to Better Use Suspense Music to Create Suspenseful Atmosphere to the Film

Are you a filmmaker? Do you own a production house? Or do you wish to create engaging yet horror content?

With the creative industry blooming extensively, the competition between different production houses is enhancing. It is important to stay one step ahead by making correct suspense music. The sub-section recommends some tips to establish an intense atmosphere in the scenes.

### Crescendos and False Crescendos

A functional tip to create cinematic suspense is by using crescendos. This suspense music continues to develop until the climax is reached. The intense music is gradually built until a startling scream is heard.

Similarly, the false crescendos come with a twist. Instead of hearing a startling scream or a murder, people hear an uncomfortable silence that reveals nothing. It messes up with the audience big time. Don't you agree?

### Repetition

Repetition is yet another technique to create a promising suspenseful aura. The same bundle of chords is repeated, establishing a rhythmic tension. A predictable pattern emphasizes the song and storyline. Additionally, the sudden chord change can be incorporated to release the hype or create a new phase.

### Dissonance

The sound of two or more inharmonious notes develops a dissonant effect. It makes the audience uncomfortable and sends a creepy vibe down the spine. The process of switching between soothing and mysterious sounds keeps the viewers on edge. The dissonant note pairings are extensively used in horror and video films.

### Dynamics

Dynamics is one of the most practiced tricks in the industry to create the needed effect. For starters, the suspense background music is enhanced. The improved pitch takes the audience towards the anticipation of the climax. After that, the chord progression hits the crescendo. The release and silence are a part of the effective dynamics of a movie.

## How Can You Choose the Best Sound Editor?

01 [What Should Be Considered Before Choose a Sound Editor?](#part1)

02 [5 Recommended Best Sound Editor in 2024](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Should Be Considered Before Choose a Sound Editor?

There are various sound editors available. We are here to help you by sharing different factors that should be considered to select a better sound editing app. Let’s start!

### 1\. Recording Options and Supported Channels

What kind of recording options are needed? If you can record from external devices, nothing is better than that. Moving on, the number of supported channels also matters a lot. This is because not every Podcast will take three or four tracks.

### 2\. Plugins and Add On

While selecting your sound editing app, check its behavior with other apps. This is because editing software expands with additional features, sounds, and other plugins and add-ons. Some of these are free, whereas some are costly.

### 3\. Operating System and Pricing

One important thing that should be checked is your device’s compatibility with the sound editor. What so ever device and operating system you use, make sure it works with your device. Lastly, remember one thing, editing like professionals do not require tons of money. It's essential that you wisely select an affordable editor.

### 4\. Editing Features

A sound editor should contain a mixture of basic and advanced editing features across its platform. It should include features such as the ones provided as follows:

* Audio Tracks: A good sound editor should at least support playing three audio tracks simultaneously in addition to the sound of the main audio track.
* Volume Control: Apart from this, an ideal sound editing software should also enable volume control for different parts of the video project.
* Normalization: Among the different features, one very noticeable feature that sound editing apps must have is Normalization. The feature automatically adjusts all the different volume levels of various sounds into balance.
* Auto Music: Auto music is the next editing feature we are going to share. This feature helps to make the length of the stock library audio according to your project length.
* Noise Filter: What do you think about noise filters? They are essential as in case of any recording that has background noise; these filters can do the magic.

### 5\. Export Audio

The audio editor should provide you with the option of changing the file format of the audio to any other supported audio format. The variety should be wide, which provides users with different opportunities to work across while exporting the audio.

There must have been instances in your life when you heard a song on the go, and it took you down memory lane, with you remembering those long-gone times when you used to listen to that song regularly.

You tried searching for that song in your phone's music app so that you might savor some sweet nostalgia, but alas, you realize that you no longer remember the song's name or any definitive lyrics or the artist's name.

Does that mean you forego that song until you remember the details? Absolutely not. There are many song finder apps that you can install on your android phone, which will help you find that song. You just need to hum whatever tune you remember of that song into the built-in-mic, and the app would do the rest.

## Best Free Song Finder Apps for Android in 2021

Some song identifier apps for Android can be downloaded and used for free. Following are 6 of the best such apps.

### 1\. [Google App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.googlequicksearchbox&hl=en&gl=US)

On 15th October 2020, Google introduced the hum to search feature to the Google app and widget. Google hum to search is like any other hum to search music app and is very easy to use. Apple users can avail of this feature in English, while Android users can search songs in excess of 20 languages. Almost 4 billion people worldwide use Google, making it the most popular app of all time.

Using your hummed input, the Google hum to search algorithm identifies probable songs that sound closer to the tune and presents you with the results. Then you choose the appropriate match from among it. The results also include information on the artist and the song, related music videos, covers, lyrics and song analysis.

This is how you use the Google app for song recognition:

Step 1- Open the Google app or Google search widget on your phone and tap the mic button.

Step 2- Either click on the "Search a song" button or say "what's this song?" before humming the tune for 10 to 15 seconds. That's it. That's all you need to do, and the Google hum to search feature will do the rest.

It is as easy to identify a song using Google Assistant. Say, "Hey Google, what's this song?" before humming the tune, and that's about what is required by the algorithm to pull out probable songs from the database.

![BeatFind Music Recognition for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/beatfind-music-recognition.jpg)

You can gather information about the song, the artist and be notified about the top tracks recorded by him/her. Beatfind will allow you to play a preview of the song on the app so that you can be sure that this is the song you are looking for and then you will have the option to listen to the full track on Deezer or Spotify or YouTube. It records your searches so that it is easier for you to find a song later.

The unique feature of this song finder app is that it can turn any room into a discotheque. It has a flashlight party mode that emanates strobes of light in sync with the music being played. You can also share identified songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 4\. [SoundHound](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.melodis.midomiMusicIdentifier.freemium)

SoundHound is simple to use and has a host of features that give you a complete music experience. It has over 300 million users. Switch on the app's listening mode and discover any song or music playing around you. You can also identify a song or a tune stuck in your mind by just humming it to the listening mode and SoundHound will do the rest.

All your song searches are stored so that you can replay them later without having to search for them all over again. The app has real-time lyrics that let you sing along your favorite song. Consequently, you can also search for lyrics of a particular song by using type search and voice search features of the app (which works like Google Assistant). You can use this voice search to conduct all types of searches on this song finder app.

You can transfer all your discovered songs to your Spotify playlist, provided you have accounts in both Spotify and SoundHound. Or you can play the discovered songs on SoundHound itself. You can also stream your Spotify playlist on SoundHound.

Apart from the above, you can get all related information on your discovered songs and share those songs with your friends and family via social media.

### 5\. [Genius – Song Lyrics & More](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.genius.android&hl=en&gl=US)

Genius is more of a lyrics finder app than a song identifier app for Android. Its database contains lyrics of more than 1.7 million songs, and that database is entirely crowdsourced. Besides lyrics, you will get authentic information regarding the backstory of the songs on the database.

![Genius — Song Lyrics & More for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/genius-song-lyrics-app.jpg)

It is very simple to use the app. Just open the app, press the soundwave button and hold the phone near the source of the music. You will get lyrics and other information on that song in a matter of seconds.

Genius is run by the inputs of dedicated and obsessed music fans. So, if you fall into that category and want more to do with a song than just listening to it, then this is a must-have app for you.

### 6\. [MusiXmatch - Lyrics for your music](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.musixmatch.android.lyrify&hl=en&gl=US)

The MusiXmatch is an app dedicated to bringing you the lyrics to any song you are listening at the moment. It has a handy floating lyrics widget feature that enables you get real-time lyrics on the track you are playing. The app has been downloaded more than 50 million times.

![MusiXmatch - Lyrics for your music for Android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/musixmatch-lyrics-for-your-music.jpg)

What is best is that, the track can be playing on any music streaming app, and the floating widget of MusiXmatch will display the lyrics in sync with the song being played. Lyrics will appear embedded in YouTube music videos, whether they be in portrait or landscape mode.

It can also translate lyrics in real-time, thus enabling you to learn a new language while doing one of your favorite tasks listening to music. You can get the lyrics and translation of any song playing around you with a single tap. You can also find your favorite song by simply typing a single line of lyrics of that song.

The app also contains allied information on the identified songs. You can be a part of this app's community and feed this database with music knowledge and information, lyrics and translations.

You can stream MusiXmatch on television via Chromecast, and the app is available on all Android wearable devices. A premium version of this app allows you to view lyrics offline, removes advertisements from the app, and enables a party mode where themes play in sync with the song lyrics.

**Conclusion**

The world of music is vast and dynamic. There are hundreds of music genres, thousands of songs in each genre and billions of recorded songs if we take into account songs from every country and language in this world.

Finding your favorite songs in this musical universe is nothing short of a treasure hunt, especially if you know very little of your coveted song( like just a tune, a jingle, a single line of lyrics, or you just heard the song for the first time).

To assist you in this hunt are the above song finder apps and lyric finders. Use them, and no song will be beyond your reach.
