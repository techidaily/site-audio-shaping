## Harmonize Your Hearings: Top Software to Extract Clean Soundscapes From Original Recordings

Background noise is the unwanted sound present in the background while recording audio. It diminishes the overall sound quality of the audio or video. It is not always possible to make a call or record an audio or video from a silent room. Then the noise was made by working machines like a fan, air conditioner, etc., or people talking. It will make it difficult to hear the recording and concentrate on the topic. Quite annoying, right?

## Best Audio Editors to Remove Background Noise from Audio

We all know background noise will reduce the overall impression of the video no matter how perfect the video is. Here we will discuss 4 applications that can be used to remove background noise from any audio clip (they are listed in no particular order).
