### 8\. [Beat Sync Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beat-sync-maker/id1434787464)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

![magisto-upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magisto-upload.jpg)

Video content creators who don’t want to go through the video editing process every time they want to post a new video on social media should consider using Magisto.

Magisto lets you choose from different editing styles like Memories, Pets or Holidays, and enables you to import footage from the device’s gallery or from Google Photos. The app also grants you access to a huge music library of songs you can use free of charge, but it also allows you to import the music you want to use in a video. Magisto generates videos automatically and syncs the cuts to the beats of the song you selected. The only downside is that you are not going to have any control over how the videos are synced to the beats or make any changes after a video is generated.

**Conclusion**

Sound and music are often overlooked during the video editing process, which often reduces the quality of a video. A simple video editing technique like syncing the cuts with beats of a song can help you create dynamic videos that gather thousands of views, shares, and likes on social media. However, having the right sync video to music beat app is essential if you want to create professional-looking videos. Which app are you going to use to sync videos to the beats of a song?
