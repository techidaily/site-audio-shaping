1\. After importing the video to the track, right-click on it and then select Detach Audio.
2\. The separated audio file will be placed in the audio track; you can then split the audio file to select the desire segments.
3\. Since Filmora supports up to 100 audio tracks, so you can copy and paste the audio clip to several audio tracks to work with next.

## Conclusion

Slaying the audio file in an echo-based filter is all the more soothing. Besides, changing the rhythm of the song redefines the music into a 360-degree angle. According to your requirements, you can opt for a suitable medium. For making use of a good web-based application, TwistedWave is the apt choice for you. Or, you can opt for Audacity software for your Windows PC to add the echo effect on your favorite audio file.
