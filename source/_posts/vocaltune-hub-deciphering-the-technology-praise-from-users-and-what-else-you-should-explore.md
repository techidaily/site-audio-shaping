## "Final Cut Pro Sound Visualization: Step-by-Step on Rendering Audio Waveforms and Their Animation Integration"

The amplitude and duration of an audio waveform vary with the duration and volume of the underlying sound. Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with **audio waveform disappearing**. Or you do want to **add some dynamic effects for audio waves**? Continue reading!

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in FCP?

When working with audio waveforms on the timeline, you can zoom in or out, or change the appearance of the clip to make the waveform taller or shorter.

There are numerous methods to examine and interact with the audio and video contained within clips in Final Cut Pro. You can:

* Expand a clip to see and modify audio elements at the channel level
* Expand a clip to view separate audio and video
* Separate audio from video clip to work with audio and video as separate, independent clips
* Change the appearance of the clipped background to display **reference waveforms** that make it easier to view audio waveforms when the volume is reduced

The reference curve shows the maximum visual resolution possible for the current sound curve. By accounting for changes in volume, the reference waveforms allow you to see the details of the sound more clearly.

1. Choose Final Cut Pro > **Preferences**, then click Edit.
2. Check the **"Show reference waveforms"** box.

When the actual curve changes shape (for example, when it shrinks because the clip's volume level is low), its full reference curve is still visible for easy reference when editing.

![audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-1.png)

**Tips:** You can click the shortcut **“Control+Option+1”** to adjust the clip appearance setting to display clips on the timeline with large audio waveforms only.

## Part 2\. How to add audio waveform animation in FCP? (2 ways)

### 2\. Use audio waveform animation templates

## Part 1: What Are the Potential Benefits of Using Noise Reduction Tools for Video Editing?

There are a handful of advantages of using noise reduction tools for video editing. These tools, including [**noise reduction Adobe Premiere**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**,** elevate overall video. The removal of unnecessary voices and noise brings clarity to the content. Viewers can focus on what is important instead of being irritated by noise. There are many potential benefits of noise removal tools discussed as follows:

### 1\. Refined Audio Quality

Once you listen to a video after recording, you realize the number of unwanted noises. Such noises can irritate viewers and may decrease your content's worth. Using noise reduction tools will assist you in dealing with such issues. You can remove unwanted audio elements like hisses, hums, or background voices. Reducing insignificant sounds will ultimately elevate the original sound quality.

### 2\. Builds Production Value

One of the indications of high-quality content or production is its ability to manage audio. Audio management like background, wind, and hum removal counts in productions. Hence, employing such tools contributes to higher production value. They help in clarifying audio, which helps with increased audience engagement.

### 3\. Maintains Audience Engagement

In today's fast-paced lifestyle, hooking an audience to the screen is a fundamental task. One of the ways to achieve it is through high-quality sound.

This extraction of background sounds maintains the audience's attention and engages them.

### 4\. Consistency Throughout the Scenes

In videos at a larger scale, combining multiple clips can cause noise havoc. Using these noise reduction tools for the overall film or separate clips brings consistency. This way, they retain the audio quality and engagement through the videos.

### 5\. Creativity and Accessibility

Using background noise removal tools can increase the chance of creativity. A high-quality video sound without distracting noises is easy to edit.
