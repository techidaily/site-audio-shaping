In today’s world of modern gaming, voice chat has become a standard tool. Only a gamer can understand the importance of communicating with the team members to be ahead of the game. With technological advancements, some of the new games have inbuilt voice-communication, but their quality and services are not that good. So, if you are in search of some great **gamer chat apps,** then this article will help you find some of the best **gaming voice chat apps** from a number of choices available on the internet, alongside their advantages and disadvantages.

Here are the seven best **gaming voice chat apps** for your gaming communication obstacles.

### 1\. [Mumble](https://www.mumble.com/)

Available on: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux

This voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) application speaks for itself. Mumble has made its mark among the best voice chat applications for gamers with a free and open-source platform, ensuring encryption support that is concerned to protect the data across the servers. This platform has been considered an efficient choice for swift gaming across Windows, Mac, and Linux, forging low-latency communication. While holding more than 100 voice participants simultaneously, this voice chat application affirms connection throughout servers: providing a steadfast connection with your friends.

Mumble features a controlled environment for the users, conforming to a server version that can be bought for as low as $7.50/month, catering 15 slots in total. Mumble emphasizes middleware, allowing additional features across the platform for extending the experience in voice chat gaming.
