If you’re just starting in the field of music production, you must have heard about DAW. Every YouTube tutorial on music production talks about [choosing the right DAW software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) before everything else.

So, what does DAW mean, and more importantly, why do you need DAW for music production? If you’re also struggling to find answers to these questions, let us help. In this guide, we’re going to explain what DAW is and how it can help a music producer in his career.

* [**Part 1: What is DAW**](#what-is-daw)
* [**Part 2: Types of DAW**](#Types-of-DAW)
* [**Part 3: How to Choose DAW**](#choose-DAW)
* [**Part 4: Which One is the Best DAW**](#best-DAW)

## Part 1: What is DAW

DAW stands for [Digital Audio Workstation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital%5Faudio%5Fworkstation). It is a dedicated software that’s designed to handle various tasks associated with music production, including instrument recording, audio editing, audio mixing, looping, etc.

While many people compare DAW to audio editors, that’s not true. Audio editors are only used to edit an audio file. A DAW, on the other hand, can be used to record different audio tracks and mix them to compile a full song.

Digital Audio Workstations are used by the [most popular DJs and music producers](https://www.thetoptens.com/best-djs-producers/) in the world, mainly for composing hip-hop and EDM tracks. Today, the market is stacked with dozens of Digital Audio Workstations, ranging from novice to professional level.

And, these tools are available for Windows as well as Mac operating systems. It means that regardless of your PC’s operating system, you have the liberty to choose the right DAW from a wide variety of options.

## Part 2: Types of DAW

Now that you know what a DAW is in music let’s take a look at how DAW software first came into the picture and why they ended up becoming a vital tool for every music producer.

In the earlier years, there wasn’t a dedicated software for compiling the entire track. Usually, four different types of tools were used to perform different operations on a single music track. These four programs included:

* Digital Audio Processor (Used to record, edit, and mix audio files)
* MIDI Sequencer (Used to Record, edit, and mix MIDI information)
* Music Notation Editor (Used to put different notes on the digital audio sheet)
* Virtual Instrument (Used to record sounds from different virtual instruments by decoding the MIDI information)

For any music composer, these four tools were essential to compile a single track. However, with time tech-giants decided to compile these four different programs into a unique software and name it DAW (Digital Audio Workstation).

As a result, DAW became a one-stop-solution to create, edit, mix, record different audio tracks without having to manage four different stand-alone tools. Over the years, several companies have released their DAW tools, boasting an extensive range of features to help creators compile a full audio track with minimal efforts.

## Part 3: How to Choose DAW

Since there are too many options to choose from, it is most likely to get confusing while choosing the right DAW for composing music. So, here are a couple of golden rules that you should always remember while choosing a Digital Audio Workstation from such full availability.

* First of all, it’s imperative to understand that every DAW will do the same thing at the end, i.e., produce music tracks. What separates these tools from each other is their set of features and the workflow. While some of these tools have a straightforward workflow, others have a steep learning curve. So, it’s better to [familiarize yourself with the workflow](https://www.creativeandproductive.com/music-production-workflow/) and features of different DAWs and then make the right decision accordingly.
* For beginners, ease of use will also be one of the significant factors while deciding what DAW software that’ll help them compose tracks without going through too much hassle is. If you’re a beginner, it’s better to choose a DAW that offers a user-friendly interface and a smooth workflow.
* If you’re not sure, it’s better to use the free demo to decide if a particular DAW will be suitable for your requirements or not.

### Free DAW Software

If you’re a beginner, it’s better to choose a free DAW software and get familiar with the features and work process of composing music. While these free tools don’t have advanced features, they’re perfect for people who want to compose music for hobby or want to learn the basics first. Since free software won’t have clutter like an advanced DAW, it would become easier to implement different functions and compile a 3-minute long track.

Some of the best free DAW software include:

* **Garageband**
* **Cakewalk by BandLab**
* **Cubase LE**
* **Ableton 9 Lite**
