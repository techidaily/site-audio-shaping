Be it obtaining the sound of a cricket or it is the **rain sounds**, the music of nature on your smartphone gives a relaxing experience whatsoever.

## What Are the Benefits of Downloading Nature Sounds?

The reason is simple.

Another reason why some may **download nature sounds** is to use them as [background music in their videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Doing so gives their footage a better acoustic experience that may attract more audience, thus giving the businesspersons decent prospects of monetary gains.

Considering this, here you will find a list of some websites from where you can **download nature sounds** with ease.
