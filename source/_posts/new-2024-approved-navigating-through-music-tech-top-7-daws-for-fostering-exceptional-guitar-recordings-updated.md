So, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online destinations where you can find a huge number of different glitch effects you can use in all of your projects for free.

Besides audio files, you can also find stock photos and videos on this platform, but before you can start downloading files you must first create an account. Moreover, some footage isn’t going to be available unless you choose to purchase a monthly or an annual subscription plan. Most glitch sound effects you can find on Audioblocks, the version of the Storyblocks platform dedicated solely to audio files, last only for a couple of seconds, which means that you can’t really use them for glitch scenes that are longer than that. Even though Audioblocks can be a valuable resource, the sound effects you can find here are only useful for short glitch sequences.

#### 3. [Freesound](https://freesound.org/people/dotY21/packs/16933/)
