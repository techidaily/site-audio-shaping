## How to Convert MP3 to Text with Filmora

The Speech to Text effect makes it seem like someone's words are transformed into text on your screen! Consider making several text tracks and beginning the next one a little later than the previous if you want to create a pause in the phrase.

##### Step1 – Add file and select speech to text feature

You can do this in four ways.

A. Select the audio asset on the timeline, then go to Tools > Audio > Speech-to-Text in the top menu bar.

![Upload files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/filmora1.jpg)

B. In the Media resource box, right-click the video/audio with the audio track and choose Speech-to-Text.

![Detect video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/filmora2.jpg)

C. Once you've selected an audio asset, click the speech-to-text tool icon in the toolbar; if there is no compatible file type on the timeline, it will not appear.

![Scenes detected automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/filmora3.jpg)

D. Right-click on the audio asset in the timeline and pick Speech-to-Text from the context menu that appears.

## Notice and Tips When Converting MP3 to Text

### Keeping it Confidential

Online services present yet another potentially serious issue: privacy. Your audio file is stored on someone else's server since you have to submit it to the service.

Your audio might be revealed to the public if that service is ever hacked or someone working there is not honest. In some circumstances, this may not be an issue, but in others, it might be a major one. In certain sectors, it might result in legal issues and large penalties. Many online voice to text services aren't an option if you operate in a profession with tight privacy rules, such as healthcare.

### Audio-to-text PC software is Better

While there are certain drawbacks to computer-assisted transcribing, it is not without merit. It's a cheap method to convert your audio, and it can "learn" from its errors and improve over time thanks to the newest machine learning technologies. Simple audio material, taking notes, and other tasks with a low degree of complexity are best handled by software or web-based solutions. Even so, you'll have to proofread everything and make a significant number of mistakes.

It's also beneficial in cases when accuracy is less crucial than having the material translated to text, such as contact center monitoring. If the material is only being read internally, perfection may be less essential than speed and cost.

## Bottom Line

Do you wish to convert an MP3 file to a text file and transcribe a speech? You may utilize the online auto transcribing tool provided by Filmora! It's quick and simple to operate. Say goodbye to hours of manually transcribing audio transcriptions and welcome to automated transcriptions that just take a few clicks. There is no software to download; everything is done online.

Simply upload your audio recording, then choose the Auto Transcribe option. You may make minor changes to the transcription if necessary. WAV, M4A, and other common audio formats are all supported by Filmora's speech-to-text service.

## Notice and Tips When Converting MP3 to Text

### Keeping it Confidential

Online services present yet another potentially serious issue: privacy. Your audio file is stored on someone else's server since you have to submit it to the service.

Your audio might be revealed to the public if that service is ever hacked or someone working there is not honest. In some circumstances, this may not be an issue, but in others, it might be a major one. In certain sectors, it might result in legal issues and large penalties. Many online voice to text services aren't an option if you operate in a profession with tight privacy rules, such as healthcare.

### Audio-to-text PC software is Better

While there are certain drawbacks to computer-assisted transcribing, it is not without merit. It's a cheap method to convert your audio, and it can "learn" from its errors and improve over time thanks to the newest machine learning technologies. Simple audio material, taking notes, and other tasks with a low degree of complexity are best handled by software or web-based solutions. Even so, you'll have to proofread everything and make a significant number of mistakes.

It's also beneficial in cases when accuracy is less crucial than having the material translated to text, such as contact center monitoring. If the material is only being read internally, perfection may be less essential than speed and cost.

## Bottom Line

Do you wish to convert an MP3 file to a text file and transcribe a speech? You may utilize the online auto transcribing tool provided by Filmora! It's quick and simple to operate. Say goodbye to hours of manually transcribing audio transcriptions and welcome to automated transcriptions that just take a few clicks. There is no software to download; everything is done online.

Simply upload your audio recording, then choose the Auto Transcribe option. You may make minor changes to the transcription if necessary. WAV, M4A, and other common audio formats are all supported by Filmora's speech-to-text service.

![arrange videos on timeline classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-4.jpg)

Step 3: If the photo size doesn’t match the video size, you can change the ratio in the crop section. This changes the aspect ratio of the video.

![set image size classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-5.jpg)

Step 4: Set the ratio for all videos and images.

Step 5: Now open the titles tab and search weddings. You can choose from a myriad of wedding-style templates on Filmora.

![add titles classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-6.jpg)

Step 6: Once you choose the title, you can drag it on your timeline. The title tag will look incredible at the start and the ending. Thus, you have to choose two title tags.

Step 7: Double-click on the first title and click on the advanced buttons. This feature enables you to customize your tags add change color, text, and fonts.

![edit title tags classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-7.jpg)

Step 8: Make the same changes for the second title tag as well.

Step 9: After selecting the right title tag, you can include elements on your images or video clips.

Step 10: Go to the Effects tab and search wedding floral. A wide range of options will appear in the media section. Choose the tags that you like the most and drag them on a new track.

Step 11: Now it’s time to add the titles to introduce the bride and groom. Furthermore, this section will also include the wedding location and other details for the wedding.

Step 12: Move to the transition section add transition presets and search for the effects you like for your video. Choose the transition and drag between the clips.

![add transitions classical background](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/classical-background-9.jpg)

Step 13: Your wedding invitation is almost ready. All you need to add is classical background music. For that, you can search the music from the audio tab or choose from the above-mentioned options. Also, you can import music from your computer to use in the video

Step 14: You can export the video from the tool and send your friends and family on Whastapp or post it on Facebook.

### Closing Words

The above-mentioned classical background music will enhance the sentiments in your wedding videos. Music helps the audience to connect with your emotions. Therefore, you should choose the classical background music carefully according to each segment. It would be best to list the video sections on a piece of paper and write the song’s name in front of it. That way, you will get a complete overview of your video’s layout.
