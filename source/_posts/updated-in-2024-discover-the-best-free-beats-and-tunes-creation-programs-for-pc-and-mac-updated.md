There is a lot more substance found in this application that you may not be able to find elsewhere. Not only is the end product amazing, but it has a very well-designed user interface. The UI has a drag and drop interface that is really easy to use. You can adjust the video so that you get an amazing quality picture on your video, as well as offering a variety of templates so that you can really get a great video. One of the greatest features is that this app can support multiple audio tracks and allows the user to overlap these tracks. You can also include voiceover tracks as well. One downside to this app is that it is only available for certain Android phones. If your phone is not one of the supported devices, you will not be able to see it in the Google Play Store.

This is a bare-bones application that is very reminiscent of the original Google Movie Studio app. There is no real ability for any in-depth video editing in this app, which is one of its downsides. It can support a single track, but it is unable to support more layers than that. You can choose between a music track or a voiceover track but not both. It is easy to use and free with ads. This is a good option if you just want something basic and no-frills to mess around with.

This is not an app for people who want some serious video editing abilities. This application is more specialized for those people who want to share the videos on their social media accounts. It is a cloud-based application with a long process time that users may be annoyed with. There are very limited features available with this application. You can add in one of their ready-to-use songs for your videos but this will create a theme that will dictate how the rest of the video looks. Essentially, there really is little customization you can get with this. There is a free version, which does watermark the video, or a premium option that comes with a monthly fee.

![ Best Free Online Voice Changer: Voice-changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-changer-online-tool.jpg)

This online voice changer doesn’t let you adjust the [bit rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or any other audio recording setting, which makes it difficult to control the noise or the peak levels in the audio files you are creating. Additionally, Voice-changer features only a limited range of voice effects and it doesn’t offer much more than the standard options that make your voice sound robotic or like you were talking from a cave.

Furthermore, the Pitch Shifter tool only lets you [change the pitch of an audio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)file by using the Pitch Shift slider or inserting a new value into the box next to the Semitones option.

![Best Free Online Voice Changer: Online Tone Generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-voice-with-online-tone-generator.jpg)

You can’t choose the output file format, and all voice recordings you edit with this tool are going to be saved in the WAV file format.

### 7\. [Voice Spice Recorder](https://voicespice.com/)

You can record new audio or use the platform’s Text-to-Speech option to start the voice changing process, but uploading a file to Voice Spice Recorder from your computer isn’t available. The platform provides you with a basic set of audio recording settings that enable you to choose how loud your microphone will be or if you want to apply an effect like Hell Demon, Space Squirrel, or change the voice from male to male female.
