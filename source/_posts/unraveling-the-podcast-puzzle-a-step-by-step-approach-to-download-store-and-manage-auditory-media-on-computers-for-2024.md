Listening to Podcasts is a great way to gather information. Name a topic, and you will find a Podcast on it. You can always count on the best Podcast shows to get quality knowledge.

You can listen to those Podcasts online. But, sometimes, users want to download the Podcast. The reason can be anything; you might want to listen offline. There are various ways to get the job done. We will walk you through different methods to download Podcasts to the computer.

## Can you download a Podcast as a file?

Yes, it's possible. But the process is a bit different for many platforms.

If you're downloading Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify and Apple Play. These apps will save your Podcast in the app's library and make it available for offline listening.

Yet, you can't get access to the saved Podcast on the PC. For this, you need third-party tools to download them to your computer. A step-by-step process of using apps and tools is given below!

But if you're downloading a Podcast from a video platform like YouTube, then yes. You can download it as a file. Here are a few methods to download podcasts. Let's walk you through them one by one.

## Method 1- Direct Download Podcasts From Podcast Manager Apps

You can save Podcasts to your computer from Podcast manager apps. Various Podcast manager apps, such as iTunes, Spotify, Apple Podcast, and many others, allow such an operation. However, it is important to note that some podcast managers require a premium subscription to be able to download podcasts.

For example, if you're using a Windows computer, you can use iTunes to download Podcasts. While Mac users can use Apple Podcasts. The steps below allow you to save Podcasts from Podcast manager apps like Spotify;

## How to Choose a DAW Software

Often, choosing the DAW software best suited to your needs can be confusing. However, a few simple questions will help you narrow down your list. Are recording instrumentals or live singing? Do you wish to use samples, in-built sounds, and loops? Are you low on budget?

Although DAW software can cost a fortune, many of these software's are accessible free with a few limitations. For instance, Studio One Prime V4, despite being free, does not support VST plug-ins. Similarly, Roland Zenbeats also requires money to be able to access additional features and VST plug-ins. One of the most favorite DAW software, namely Cakewalk by Bandlab, offers exceptional features complete with VST plug-in support but is limited to use on Windows only.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two. But despite lacking a few high-end features, the free DAW software's are productive enough, owing to the rapid technological advancements, to render your audios flawless and professional sounding.

## Conclusion

Irrespective of the fact that the above set of free DAW software is pretty easy than the others, each one of them requires some time to get accustomed. If you ever get stuck while handling the above best DAW for beginners, always remember to refer to the online learning videos that come handy to serve you better.

Once you get the hang of the software, you can easily manage it with ease.

## How to Choose a DAW Software

Often, choosing the DAW software best suited to your needs can be confusing. However, a few simple questions will help you narrow down your list. Are recording instrumentals or live singing? Do you wish to use samples, in-built sounds, and loops? Are you low on budget?

Although DAW software can cost a fortune, many of these software's are accessible free with a few limitations. For instance, Studio One Prime V4, despite being free, does not support VST plug-ins. Similarly, Roland Zenbeats also requires money to be able to access additional features and VST plug-ins. One of the most favorite DAW software, namely Cakewalk by Bandlab, offers exceptional features complete with VST plug-in support but is limited to use on Windows only.

Hence, it seems like you can't have everything in one software. Even the best, free DAW software lack a feature or two. But despite lacking a few high-end features, the free DAW software's are productive enough, owing to the rapid technological advancements, to render your audios flawless and professional sounding.

## Conclusion

Irrespective of the fact that the above set of free DAW software is pretty easy than the others, each one of them requires some time to get accustomed. If you ever get stuck while handling the above best DAW for beginners, always remember to refer to the online learning videos that come handy to serve you better.

Once you get the hang of the software, you can easily manage it with ease.

## Part 1\. What are podcast directories?

A podcast directory is a listening app. It's the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.

## Part 2\. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024

Thankfully, [research conducted by EdisonResearch](https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/) shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories. So this list will help us locate the best podcasting directories. And it can multiply your audience size and quickly reach a more extensive user base.

According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:

![edison podcast metrics](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-1.jpg)

You must retain that Edison's research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.

Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it's all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.

### 1\. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.

Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.

![podcast directory youtube](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-2.jpg)

Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create video-based podcasts seamlessly. You can simply convert the video podcasts into an audio format using Filmora itself and then reupload the same Podcast to even audio-based podcast directories.

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For Win 7 or later(64-bit)

[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).

* **User Review of YouTube on G2**: "YouTube is one of those sites that you can't live without for a business. Everyone knows what YouTube is, and users (globally) use the platform daily."
* **Monthly User Base**: Over 2.5 billion active users.
* **Supported OS**: All major OS and web browsers.

### 2\. [Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/)

Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.

Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.

![podcast directory spotify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-3.jpg)

Spotify's personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily/ Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.

* **User Review of Spotify on G2**: "I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials."
* **Monthly User Base**: Over 360 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: All major OS and web browsers.

### 3\. [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasters.apple.com/)

Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.

It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.

![podcast directory apple podcast](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-4.jpg)

The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.

In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.

* **User Review of Apple Podcast**: "Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service."
* **Monthly User Base**: Over 28.5 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: All Apple devices.

### 4\. [Google Podcasts](https://podcasts.google.com/)

Google Podcasts has over 100 million downloads on Play Store alone and is also available on the web, App Store, Blackberry, and ChromeOS users. A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.

However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.

![podcast directory google podcasts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-5.jpg)

Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.

* **User Review of Google Podcast**

"Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It's simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 30 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 5\. [Pandora](https://www.pandora.com/)

Pandora has over 64 million monthly active users, with a listener spending up to 24 hours/monthly on the platform. It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you're creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.

![podcast directory pandora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-6.jpg)

Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.

However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast's team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.

* **User Review of Pandora Podcast**

"Pandora Podcasts recommendations are a blessing for me, who always finds it confusing to locate the right episode to spend my time on."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 64 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.

### 6\. [Audible](https://www.audible.com/ep/podcasts?source%5Fcode=BLGORWS0107160001)

Although popular among audiobook lovers, Audible has a considerable podcast following too. Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.

Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there's a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.

![podcast directory audible](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/01/directory-of-podcasts-7.jpg)

It is important to note that both Amazon Music and Audible offer podcasts for entirely free to users, so a more extensive user base prefers these platforms over paid platforms.

* **User Review of Pandora Podcast**

"You get to listen to any audiobook in the "included" library no matter which subscription you purchase.."

* **Monthly User Base**: Over 64 million active users.
* **Supported OS**: Android, iOS,

### 7\. [NPR One](https://one.npr.org/)

With an average listener spending up to 145 minutes weekly, the NPR One podcast directory is one of the best podcast directories you can trust to submit your show online. The podcast directory has a userbase of over 500 thousand users globally, and

* **User Review of NPR One Podcast**

"I've been using this app for years now. It's been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I'm not a super picky consumer, especially when I don't pay for the app!

But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It's annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer."
