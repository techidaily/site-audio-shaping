A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.

After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?

Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.

**Tip 2: Record A Test**

After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.

Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.

**Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording**

After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating/cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.

Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.

Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.

## Part 3: Tips For Removing Background Noise From Audio BEFORE You Record

We all want to get rid of the noisy background from our audio. Follow these tips below to get clean and supreme audio quality:

**Tip 1: Avoid Noisy Places**

The easiest method to avoid having noisy audio in the first place is to avoid having noisy elements and surroundings in the first place. Recording in a peaceful area is essential for this to be accomplished.

A professional recording studio is not required to get excellent results, but you should choose the quietest room or place that you can locate.

After that, you should get acquainted with the normal ambient noises heard in that location. Is there any outside noise, such as heavy trucks or other traffic? What about the heating and air conditioning systems, for that matter? Is there a sound of the fan turning on and off?

Does it seem like you can hear your co-workers or people conversing in the adjacent rooms? Is there a buzzing sound coming from the fluorescent lighting? Those are just a few examples of the kind of sounds that might appear on your voice-over recording when you record it yourself.

**Tip 2: Record A Test**

After that, make a practice tape of your room. You do not need to talk. However, it would help if you used the same microphone you will be using for your voice-over recording.

Take 10-20 seconds of the ambient noise in the room and save it to your computer. This is referred to as recording the room tone.

**Tip 3: Analyze the Test Recording**

After that, put on your headphones and listen to your room tone recording. What sounds do you hear that you can quickly remove from your environment? Suppose you can hear the fan from your heating/cooling system running. You may turn it off while you are recording.

Alternatively, if you hear individuals conversing in the background, you might respectfully request that they transfer their discussion to a more appropriate location. If at all feasible, you should switch off any buzzing lights.

Your room tone recording will also assist you in reducing audio noise once you have completed your recording session. Your room tone recording may serve as a baseline for your audio program, which can then be used to eliminate noise.

## Part 4: FAQs About Removing Audio Noise From Video Online

**1.Can Background Noise Be Removed From Audio**

Yes, the background can be removed from audio easily nowadays, whether it's after you've done recording or before recording audio; there are plenty of online software and applications, both available for your PC and smartphones.

These can help you get rid of the unwanted noise from your audio—some of the best online websites that can help you achieve that have been reviewed above. Choose the one that meets your needs!

**2\. Is There Anything I Can Do To Prevent Noisy Audio Before I Record?**

Prior to recording, it is essential to reduce any acoustic noise sources if at all feasible. During recording, airflow may cause havoc on microphone preamplifiers, resulting in artifacts that may be difficult to remove.

Be careful to utilize adequate windscreens on your microphones, mainly when recording outside. Sound sources such as wind noise, for example, may frequently be discovered and appropriately eliminated by giving them a cursory listen via headphones.
