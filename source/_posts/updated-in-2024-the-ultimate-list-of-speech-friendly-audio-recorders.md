 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Whether you’re a player or a viewer, you know that video game sound effects are incredibly crucial for immersion into a game.

Many times, watching or playing these games would be boring without that little addition. Streamers use all kinds of video game sound effects in their productions, and if you [make video games](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you’ll use them too.

But, can you find classic video game sound effects that you’re able to use on YouTube with no problem?

Are there options that are royalty-free and won’t get you kicked off of your streaming website?

Here are the 8 best free video game sound effects that are available on the web.

## 8 Excellent Video Game Sound Effects

### 1. [Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://www.sounds-resource.com/gamecube/crashtagteamracing/sound/26205/)

Do you remember the days of zipping around the track as Crash Bandicoot and all of his friends? If so, then this is the sound that will likely come to your mind.

If you’re looking for some old-school Game Cube noises, this is about the most iconic one out there, and you can get it for free.

![Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/crash-tag-team-racing-sound.jpg)

### 2. [Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://www.soundsnap.com/taking%5Foff%5Fback%5Fbattery%5Fcap%5Fin%5Fxbox%5Fone%5Fcontroller%5Fwav)

Wireless controllers changed the world as we know it, and in the past, we needed to change the batteries quite frequently.

So, this noise will take your audience back to the good old days when you had to take the back battery cap off. This little “click” has a lot of nostalgia associated with it!

![Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/taking-off-back-battery-cap.jpg)

### 3. [Sfx RVGSE1 Bleep 1](https://sounds.com/samples/release/4833/sound/693773)

Space – the final frontier, and the setting of a wide array of video games. Whether you’re a Mega Man aficionado or you are flying the skies with Star Fox, this “bleep” will take you and your audience back in time.

Most commonly associated with ray guns, weaponry on aircraft, or quick teleporting, this unique noise has a lot of uses and is fun to add to any project that you may be putting together.

![Sfx RVGSE1 Bleep 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/bleep.jpg)

### 4. [Platform Game Shot](https://www.audioblocks.com/stock-audio/platform-game-shot-hel8el2nlphk0wxseuy.html)

This sound is similar to the previous “bleep”, but it’s a lot shorter in duration and it has a very specific purpose to it. You could repeat this noise a few times in a row in order to imitate the “pew pew pew” you may hear when someone is shooting in a platform game. Since it’s only a one-second clip, you have a lot of flexibility as to when and how you’re going to be able to use it in your projects.

![Platform Game Shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/platform-game-shot.jpg)

### 5. [Jump Landing Sound](https://opengameart.org/content/jump-landing-sound)

Jumping into oblivion is a favorite pastime of many gamers of all backgrounds, and all of us know that crazy feeling that we get when we’re getting ready to leap, so to speak.

But, if we aren’t sure of what’s on the other side, we breathe a sigh of relief when that simple “thud” indicates that we’ve hit solid ground. This jump landing sound may bring back some of those memories for you.

![Jump Landing Sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/jump-landing-sound.jpg)

### 6. [Classic Game Sound Jump](https://www.zapsplat.com/music/classic-game-sound-jump-version-5/)

When was the last time that you played a platform-style game? Many of us know of great games like Mario, and we know the most iconic of video game sound effects – the jump. This “boing” noise has been used in many contexts over the years, and it’s not a surprise that we list it as one of the best sound effects that you need to know.

![Classic Game Sound Jump](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/classic-game-sound-jump.jpg)

### 7. [Starfleet Countdown](https://elements.envato.com/starfleet-countdown-with-british-female-voice-UX85D2Z)

Generic countdowns are useful in a lot of situations in video games, but why should you record yourself doing it when there are so many free options available? This particular countdown is performed by a British female’s voice, which makes it sound so much more dire and exciting. It can add a little bit of flair to whatever sort of a countdown that you may be used in your game or during your stream.

### 7. [Starfleet Countdown](https://elements.envato.com/starfleet-countdown-with-british-female-voice-UX85D2Z)

Generic countdowns are useful in a lot of situations in video games, but why should you record yourself doing it when there are so many free options available? This particular countdown is performed by a British female’s voice, which makes it sound so much more dire and exciting. It can add a little bit of flair to whatever sort of a countdown that you may be used in your game or during your stream.

Whether you’re a player or a viewer, you know that video game sound effects are incredibly crucial for immersion into a game.

Many times, watching or playing these games would be boring without that little addition. Streamers use all kinds of video game sound effects in their productions, and if you [make video games](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you’ll use them too.

But, can you find classic video game sound effects that you’re able to use on YouTube with no problem?

Are there options that are royalty-free and won’t get you kicked off of your streaming website?

Here are the 8 best free video game sound effects that are available on the web.

## 8 Excellent Video Game Sound Effects

### 1. [Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://www.sounds-resource.com/gamecube/crashtagteamracing/sound/26205/)

Do you remember the days of zipping around the track as Crash Bandicoot and all of his friends? If so, then this is the sound that will likely come to your mind.

If you’re looking for some old-school Game Cube noises, this is about the most iconic one out there, and you can get it for free.

![Crash Tag Team Racing Sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/crash-tag-team-racing-sound.jpg)

### 2. [Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://www.soundsnap.com/taking%5Foff%5Fback%5Fbattery%5Fcap%5Fin%5Fxbox%5Fone%5Fcontroller%5Fwav)

Wireless controllers changed the world as we know it, and in the past, we needed to change the batteries quite frequently.

So, this noise will take your audience back to the good old days when you had to take the back battery cap off. This little “click” has a lot of nostalgia associated with it!

![Taking Off Back Battery Cap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/taking-off-back-battery-cap.jpg)

### 3. [Sfx RVGSE1 Bleep 1](https://sounds.com/samples/release/4833/sound/693773)

Space – the final frontier, and the setting of a wide array of video games. Whether you’re a Mega Man aficionado or you are flying the skies with Star Fox, this “bleep” will take you and your audience back in time.

Most commonly associated with ray guns, weaponry on aircraft, or quick teleporting, this unique noise has a lot of uses and is fun to add to any project that you may be putting together.

![Sfx RVGSE1 Bleep 1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/bleep.jpg)

### 4. [Platform Game Shot](https://www.audioblocks.com/stock-audio/platform-game-shot-hel8el2nlphk0wxseuy.html)

This sound is similar to the previous “bleep”, but it’s a lot shorter in duration and it has a very specific purpose to it. You could repeat this noise a few times in a row in order to imitate the “pew pew pew” you may hear when someone is shooting in a platform game. Since it’s only a one-second clip, you have a lot of flexibility as to when and how you’re going to be able to use it in your projects.

![Platform Game Shot](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/platform-game-shot.jpg)

### 5. [Jump Landing Sound](https://opengameart.org/content/jump-landing-sound)

Jumping into oblivion is a favorite pastime of many gamers of all backgrounds, and all of us know that crazy feeling that we get when we’re getting ready to leap, so to speak.

But, if we aren’t sure of what’s on the other side, we breathe a sigh of relief when that simple “thud” indicates that we’ve hit solid ground. This jump landing sound may bring back some of those memories for you.
