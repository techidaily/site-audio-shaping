## Part 2: What is MP3/MP4?

MP3 is short for MPEG (Moving Pictures Experts Group) Layer 3, an audio file format for storing digital audio data on a computer system. There are three types of audio file format:

* Uncompressed audio format: such as WAV, AIFF, AU etc.
* Lossless compressed audio format: .ape, .m4a etc.
* Lossy compressed audio format: MP3

Here is a comparision table. it is helpful to understand MP3 to MP4.

| File extension | Format | Handles              | Standards                  | Portability                      |               |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| MP3            | .mp3   | audio                | audio                      | ISO/IEC 11172-3, ISO/IEC 13818-3 | almost all    |
| MP4            | .mp4   | multimedia container | audio, video, text, images | ISO/IEC 14496-14                 | iPods/iPhones |

MP3 files are compressed to approximately 1/10 the original size of the music file without a corresponding decrease in fidelity and perceived audio quality. Therefore it’s rather small in size, making it very easy to download, transfer and share. Converting MP3 to any other music formats is also possible by using appropriate conversion software programs, so it it easy to conver MP3 to MP4 with a right converter.  
  
MP4 and MP3 sure sound familiar and it's possible that some may think that MP4 might be the next step for MP3\. However that’s not the case. Indeed they are quite different in that MP4, which is short for MPEG-4, is a multimedia container format, used to store audio, and/or video data, as well as other data such as subtitles as well as images etc.
  
The biggest difference between them is that MP3 can only store audio, whereas MP4 can store multiple formats of multimedia files.

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.
      * Members are matched by their unique code.
      * On the site, you can video chat with others.
      * You can easily use the site's features.

#### **3\.** [**YouNow**](https://www.younow.com/)

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.
      * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.
      * You can also make friends and send and receive gifts from them

#### [**4\. TinyChat**](https://tinychat.com/)

![tiny-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiny-poster.png)

An alternative chat platform, TinyChat, offers chat rooms with video feeds of 12 each.

TinyChat is also a browser-based IM client and can be accessed from a PC, mobile device, or browser. While Omegle does not offer coins or points for unlocking special achievements or increasing your chances of landing in the live directory, it does provide you with a chance to interact with other users. A 500-coin token will also be awarded to you if you promote your room via TinyChat.

![chatrad-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrad-poster.png)

People need to act the same in the real world, where they don't run around naked or try to expose themselves all of the time... at least not in my world. Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.

      * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People

As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you're bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music.

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.

      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.

Despite being a random video chat site, ChatRad is managed by a team of 24x7 moderators, so anything 18 and older can take advantage of the service in a safe environment regardless of their sexual orientation.

**Features:**

      * Very Strict Policies For Disrespectful People
      * The chat is moderated 24/7 by an active team of moderators.
      * It offers a very safe environment for people.

The Bazoocam webcam chat environment is another random digital camera chat site that maintains a high level of cleanliness. Like most of the other websites mentioned, you're paired up with an interloper haphazardly. Press "skip" and move on to the next person if you are unsatisfied with what you see.

As icebreakers or when you are bored of talking about yourself, you can join one of the multiplayer games on Boomcam. You are advised to do something unusual if you're bored, but you are urged to wear your clothes. Put your best foot forward when playing golf in fancy dress or taking part in your favorite music. Try playing a string or wind instrument, and you'll find many people to talk to.

**Features**

      * The site offers a very high level of cleanliness.

      * If you don't like a person you can skip to check the next candidate.

It is similar to Omegle in that there are random live video chats and text chat rooms available, but iMeetzu goes over and above that. Once you get past the randomness, you are given the option of joining a free online dating service or friend finder.

One of the main reasons we use the Internet is to be social. Interaction brings comfort and satisfaction to most normal people, and most people need to interact. It is for this reason that Facebook is so popular. Nevertheless, there are other websites where people can meet. People usually post comments on these sites and return later to see if someone else has responded. However, many sites facilitate real-time online conversations that are as close as you can get to face-to-face communications.

Omegle's website allows members to converse via video, audio, or plain text. You can talk to a stranger and meet random people there. Unfortunately, Omegle has become overpopulated like most big sites. Also, on Omegle, many people prey upon others and make illicit conversations due to which using Omegle is getting difficult day by day. This article brings you a list of 10 websites like Omegle that serve the same purpose as Omegle. You can say them as Omegle alternatives, but they are more secure and more fun to use.

## Best Websites Like Omegle (Omegle Alternatives)

#### [**1. Chatroulette**](https://chatroulette.com/)

![chatroulette-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatroulette-poster.png)

The webcam-based Chatroulette service is notable for pairing users with random strangers using a random pairing algorithm. Instead of using guns, you parry verbally with typewritten messages and/or a digital camera, and the person who does not agree with you leaves the chat ("kills the conversation").

A 17-year-old child who created it in 2009 ran it out of a chamber in his parents' house. Despite not running any advertisements, this website grew to a massive size through word of mouth. In recent years, after much trial and error, it has finally reached the stage where it can distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate behavior.

Moderators screen violators who have not adhered to the site's terms of service. Users who do not do so will not be able to access the site. Approximately half of the users of this website are under thirty, and there are more men than women. There's no doubt that it's R-rated. Like Omegle, this site is a great alternative.

**Features:**

      * Anonymously Chat With Strangers.
      * Millions of Users Across Different Countries
      * Android and iOS apps are also available.
      * Fewer Scammers and Bots.
      * One of the best monitoring and moderating systems.

#### **2\.** [**ChatRandom**](https://chatrandom.com/)

![chatrandom-poster1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/chatrandom-poster1.jpg)

The ChatRandom service is a wonderful, chaotic, and people-packed place where users share all kinds of information. There is no shortage of fun stuff on ChatRandom, no matter what you want. Even though this stranger chat website has declined in popularity, it remains popular in the minds of many. The community is moderate, and there are a variety of people in it.

There have been a couple of changes to the site over the years, and what makes it one of the best websites like Omegle is its polished UI, better matchmaking algorithm, and general trend of catering to both genders.

**Features:**

      * You do not need to register to chat on Chatrandom; it is free to use.
      * Users of the site can access most of its features free of charge.
      * A total of 20 languages are available for users to use.
      * Chat rooms are available for members to connect.
      * Members are matched by their unique code.
      * On the site, you can video chat with others.
      * You can easily use the site's features.

![younow-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/younow-poster.png)

Is YouNow an app for broadcasting, chatting, streaming, or watching live videos? In contrast to Omegle, YouNow's goal is to create a large audience, and trend, and build a loyal following.

Users can comment or buy gold bars to share with others during the viewing process. A user must be 13 years of age or older to use the chat app. Users of YouNow must register to begin chatting, unlike Omegle, which doesn't require them to create a Facebook or Twitter account before chatting.

Though both platforms still have privacy concerns, YouNow lets you customize your usernames so that they don't match anything about your Facebook or Twitter identities. Additionally, YouNow has stricter guidelines that prohibit sexual content, nudity, and bullying. However, there is no guarantee that such content will be monitored or removed.

The community guidelines can be broken, and you can report violators, but there's no way to guarantee you won't be exposed to objectionable live content. As long as you retain ownership of your content, posting content to the app gives the app permission to use it how it likes.

**Features:**

      * Allows you to integrate social media platforms.
      * Web, Android, and iOS versions are available.
      * Allows you to start a broadcast.
      * You can join the broadcast of other streams also to interact with them.
