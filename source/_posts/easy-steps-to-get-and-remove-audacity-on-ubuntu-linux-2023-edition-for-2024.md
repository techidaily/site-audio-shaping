## Part 3: Free Music Production Software Online

### 11\. [Soundation](https://soundation.com/)

Soundation is a platform that provides free music production software online only capabilities. The free version and three paid versions are offered. You can use this to build your tracks unless you have the resources to do so if you need a web-based music maker and editor.

If you pay, even after you have made your music, you can always cancel. Remember first to save them to your hard drive. If you need paid characteristics, pay for the monthly plan again through PayPal, and you have to use it for a month.

**Pros**

* Great SSL-modelled mixer

It is also confirmed that you will share music and tracks directly with YouTube, SoundCloud, and Facebook on its own publishing site. They have premium releases from Loopmasters and some fantastic online VSTs, for example, Heisenberg, Machiniste, Bassline, and Beatbox 8 & 9.

**Pros**

### 13\. [Soundtrap](https://www.soundtrap.com/)

Soundtrap is not only an online music studio but a training site for students and instructors. The STEAM Curriculum is an online learning resource that helps students to follow music and podcasts, incorporated into the Web app. As we mentioned earlier, in addition to the online Web App, you can also use it on different devices, share it with other users, and work in innovative projects for your music.

The interface is simple, easy to use, and easy to understand. It is simply an instrument for innovation; you don't have to learn how to apply VST or any other technical elements to music creation. You can also record your MIDI instruments directly from your machine or device's mic.

**Pros**

* It provides a great platform for teachers to teach their students
* It is very easy to use

**Cons**

* It only has a limited number of plugins
* It cannot be used professionally

## Conclusion

If you make music on a computer, the most important resource in your artistic arsenal is your DAW; in your home recording system, you 're probably going to have the MIDI keyboard, audio interface, studio monitor speakers, and maybe a microphone or two. But your program is at the core of it all. Not everyone can afford expensive DAWs, but one must not worry as free music production software are present to aid us.

It is important to have a DAW with which you are pleased and, perhaps more importantly, a DAW, which allows you to turn your ideas into music as quickly and painlessly as possible. So make sure you choose the best one for you according to your needs. Hopefully, this guide will aid you!
