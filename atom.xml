Premiere Elements"></a>2. Premiere Elements</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $59.99 as a single app</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.</p><h3 id="3-Cyberlink-PowerDirector"><a href="#3-Cyberlink-PowerDirector" class="headerlink" title="3.

After you add an audio file to the app’s timeline, you should right-click on it and chose the Use Automatic Music Beat Detection option.</p><p>You can then set the minimum amount of time between two beat markers and click on the Detect button if you want to add markers automatically. Optionally you can also add markers during playback manually by clicking on the Add button or using the A keyboard shortcut. When done you should click on the Apply button in the Automatic Music Beat Detection dialogue box and beat markers are going to be added to the timeline automatically. Nonetheless, you must edit all video clips you want to add to your project manually.</p><h3 id="4-Adobe-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#4-Adobe-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="4. Adobe Premiere Pro"></a>4. Adobe Premiere Pro</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> $20,99 as a single app</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> macOS, Windows</p><p>Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.</p><h3 id="5-Final-Cut-Pro-X"><a href="#5-Final-Cut-Pro-X" class="headerlink" title="5.

Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song.

Beat Sync Maker</h3><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p><p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS 11.0 or later</p><p>Roland Corporation has manufactured some of the most iconic instruments in the history of electronic music, so it is no wonder that their Beat Sync Maker is one of the best apps DJs can use to create VJ-ing for their performances. The Auto Beat Sync technology detects beats automatically and syncs them with visual effects. You can choose from five types of visual effects, apply them to the videos you are mixing and adjust their intensity by simply dragging a slider left or right. What’s more, the app features 18 pre-installed video clips you can use for mixing and it also allows you to import video clips that are stored on your iPhone’s or iPad’s camera roll. The maximum duration of a video you can export from the free version of this app is limited to just thirty seconds, and you must make an in-app purchase if you want to create longer videos with Beat Sync Maker.</p><h3 id="9-Magisto"><a href="#9-Magisto" class="headerlink" title="9.

Magisto lets you choose from different editing styles like Memories, Pets or Holidays, and enables you to import footage from the device’s gallery or from Google Photos.

It allows you to adjust the audio tempo to sync with the video. You can slow down or speed up the audio with the button and setting. Auto Audio Sync is the ability to sync video and audio together automatically. Moreover, it is an all-in-one video editor with powerful functionality and a fully stacked feature set. It makes professional video editing easy with an intuitive interface, drag-and-drop editing, and advanced video editing features.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Steps-to-Use-Auto-Audio-Sync-Tool"><a href="#Steps-to-Use-Auto-Audio-Sync-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool"></a>Steps to Use Auto Audio Sync Tool</h3><p>This tool is best as it gives a perfect result when you try to match your audio files with your video files. For example, you might have a YouTube channel, and you record your audio from a Microphone, your video from a webcam camera, and your screen from your computer. The audio directly from the camera could be a little faint, resulting from the recording being farther from where you are. While the audio from the microphone would give you a high-quality audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-3.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>First, detach your audio file from your screen recording as the tool works with an audio file and a video file. Right-click on the audio file and click on detach audio to separate the audio file from the screen recording.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-4.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Return the audio file and the screen recording to the normal position, which gives you three layers on the timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-5.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><p>Next, select your audio and your video by making sure both footages are related to each other and then right-click and then tap the audio synchronization. This will sync the audio and the video together, and the echo will seize because the footage will perfectly match the audio.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/05/auto-audio-sync-6.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Filmora"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-in-Premiere-Pro-–-Merging-Audio-and-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video"></a>Part 2: How to Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro – Merging Audio and Video</h2><p>The first way that can help you sync audio and video is merging the two files. You can simply get the media from the folders and this allows you to sync a max of 16 audio files to single video.</p><ul><li>To proceed, press <strong>Control</strong> and <strong>Command</strong>&gt; key on Windows and Mac respectively. Now, pick out the two files that you want to merge. You will now get the Merge Clips menu having a list of options. Choose Audio option and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-premiere-pro.jpg"                      alt="Sync Audio to Video in Premiere Pro"                ></p><ul><li>Premiere Pro will now examine your video’s audio with the help of External audio and find out the similarities. In a couple of minutes, you will receive a new file with the name given to it in the Merge Clips menu.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-Manually-in-Premiere-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro"></a>Part 3: How to Sync Audio to Video Manually in Premiere Pro</h2><ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Another is the manual way to sync audio to your videos. In order to work with this uncomplicated way of synchronization, get your video clip and the audio file into the timeline. Make sure to stack up the two files loosely (do not group them).</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-file-sync-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="import files"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2</strong>: Now, you may have either used a professional slate&#x2F;clapper or simply done a single clap with your hands to give a clue to start performing. All you need to do is to zoom the video file in the timeline. Look for the spike in waveforms that shows the slate. Where you notice the spike, slide the audio file and make the markers lined up.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/merge-audio-manually.jpg"                      alt="merge audio manually"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3</strong>: Start playing the clip to see if it works perfectly. Just in case, if a little tweaking is still required, click the audio file and hold down the Shift key while tapping left or right arrow key to adjust the audio file as per requirement.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/finish-sync-audio.jpg"                      alt="finish sync audio"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-with-Plug-in"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Sync-Audio-to-Video-with-Plug-in" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in"></a>Part 4: How to Sync Audio to Video with Plug in</h2><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.redgiant.com/products/shooter-pluraleyes/" >PluralEyes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the next ideal option to work with. It is a plug-in and comes for $200 from Red Giant. When you have the projects like documentaries which include numerous camera angles, PluralEyes easily handles such stuff and make audio and video synchronization easy for you.</p><ul><li>For this, run PluralEyes and hit on <strong>Add Media</strong> to import the clip. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the file directly to Premiere Pro. Now, click on <strong>Synchronize</strong> and let the program do the job.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/sync-audio-PluralEyes.jpg"                      alt="PluralEyes sync audio"                ></p><ul><li>You will notice the synced clips in green while the files that are not synchronized will show up in red as errors. In case there are files with the red error, you need to get to the Sync drop-down menu and click <strong>Try Really Hard</strong>.</li><li>When the entire files are synced, hit on <strong>Export Timeline</strong> and you can then drag the exported project into Premiere Pro.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly"><a href="#Bonus-Tips-How-to-Record-Audio-Properly" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly"></a>Bonus Tips: How to Record Audio Properly</h2><p>Nothing is worse than a bad quality audio file. You must have always wanted to keep a high-quality audio file, correct? More than desire, it is a vital thing to have. Hence, to record your audio appropriately, you must have a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >quality microphone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and an <a class="link"   href="https://www.omnicoreagency.com/best-digital-voice-recorders/" >audio recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that should stand out from others. This dual combination is significant in capturing the sound in an excellent quality and they indeed provide better output than an on-camera microphone.</p><p>The audio recorders with a little more price employ XLR cables. On the other hand, some affordable ones make use of the ideal headphone jacks i.e. 1&#x2F;8” jacks.</p><p>You just need to have the right equipment with you when you are looking for the quality output for recording audio files.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"

One is using the fade handles, and the other is using the audio inspector. Before using iMovie audio fade-out effects, please import your video and audio files to iMovie and start a new project.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Use-Fade-Handles-to-Add-Fade-in-Fade-out-Effect-in-iMovie"><a href="#Method-1-Use-Fade-Handles-to-Add-Fade-in-Fade-out-Effect-in-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Use Fade Handles to Add Fade in&#x2F;Fade out Effect in iMovie"></a>Method 1: Use Fade Handles to Add Fade in&#x2F;Fade out Effect in iMovie</h3><p>Firstly, let’s take a look at the video below to check how to fade audio in&#x2F;out the audio in iMovie with fade handles.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enable-Audio-Waveform"><a href="#Step-1-Enable-Audio-Waveform" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Enable Audio Waveform"></a>Step 1. Enable Audio Waveform</h4><p>When the project opens, check “Show Waveforms” at the bottom of the Project window.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/show-waveforms-imovie.jpg"                      alt="Show Audio Waveforms -iMovie"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The Blue waveforms indicate the sound recorded within your video clips.

Move Pointer to Apply Fade Effects"></a>Step 2. Move Pointer to Apply Fade Effects</h4><p>Move the pointer over a waveform, and drag the small gray fade handle at the left of the clip to adjust the fade audio in effect. Then drag the small fade handle at the right of the clip to adjust the fade-out effect.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-audio-fade-in-pointer.jpg"                      alt="iMovie fade in audio pointer"                ></p><h4 id="Step-3-Playback-to-Check"><a href="#Step-3-Playback-to-Check" class="headerlink" title="Step 3. Playback to Check"></a>Step 3. Playback to Check</h4><p>Move the playhead to the beginning part of the clips with fade effects to check the fade-in and fade-out effects. If everything works OK, uncheck “Show Waveforms” to hide the waveforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-audio-fade-out-pointer.jpg"                      alt="imovie audio fade out pointer"                ></p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Remove Background Noise from Video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-the-Audio-Inspector-to-Apply-Fade-in-Fade-Out-Effect-in-iMovie"><a href="#Method-2-Use-the-Audio-Inspector-to-Apply-Fade-in-Fade-Out-Effect-in-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use the Audio Inspector to Apply Fade in&#x2F;Fade Out Effect in iMovie"></a>Method 2: Use the Audio Inspector to Apply Fade in&#x2F;Fade Out Effect in iMovie</h3><p>To fade audios in and out in iMovie with the audio inspector, you can follow these steps:</p><h4 id="Step-1-Open-Your-iMovie-Project-and-Select-a-Clip"><a href="#Step-1-Open-Your-iMovie-Project-and-Select-a-Clip" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Open Your iMovie Project and Select a Clip"></a>Step 1. Open Your iMovie Project and Select a Clip</h4><p>Double-click the video clip, choose “Clip Adjustments” to open the Inspector, and then click the “Audio” tab.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/imovie-audio-fade-effects.jpg"                      alt="resize video" title="resize video"                ></p><p>If there are two audio tracks, and you want to set the fade in and fade out in iMovie for the background music, you can double-click the background music clip to open the audio inspector. This inspector is a little different. If you don’t know how to add background music to iMovie, you can refer to this post: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >add background music in iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Set-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effect"><a href="#Step-2-Set-the-Fade-In-and-Fade-Out-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Set the Fade In and Fade Out Effect"></a>Step 2. Set the Fade In and Fade Out Effect</h4><p>In the window, you can manually set the fade-in and fade-out length by dragging the slider bar to the right or left.</p><p>If you do not choose “Manual”, that means you’d like iMovie to automatically set it for you. Usually, when you drag video clips to the Project, iMovie will set the fade-in and fade-out effect randomly by increasing the audio volume at the beginning of the clip and decrease the volume at the end of the clip.</p><p>If you manually adjust the effect, you can have a better effect.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Save-the-Audio-Fade-In-and-Out-Effect"><a href="#Step-3-Save-the-Audio-Fade-In-and-Out-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Step 3.

Then click “Done” to save the audio fade-in and fade-out effects in iMovie.</p><p>Now, that’s done! I hope the above information does help you to set the fade effects to smooth your video and audio transitions.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Get More iMovie Themes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-An-Easier-Way-to-Fade-Audio-and-Music-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-An-Easier-Way-to-Fade-Audio-and-Music-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: An Easier Way to Fade Audio and Music on Mac"></a>Part 2: An Easier Way to Fade Audio and Music on Mac</h2><p>Let watch the video below to check how to apply fade-in and fade-out effects in an easier way with <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Wondershare Filmora for Mac</strong></a>.

Imagine a world without sounds or music, and on the other hand, you live in a world that has music everywhere! Which one would you actually prefer to live in?</p><p>Likewise, foreground or background music for videos plays a vital role. It is a key ingredient to draw the attention of your viewers that may eventually convert into likes or subscribes or purchases. Incorporating background music in YouTube videos or private videos is an excellent way to create engaging and compelling content.</p><p>Here’s a quick fact for you!</p><p>Do you know? <em>“13 hours of video content is published every single minute over the renowned YouTube platform!”</em> And a huge chunk of these endearing videos generates a powerful impression on entertained viewers only because of the incorporated catchy background music.</p><h2 id="Key-Takeaways-to-Choose-the-Right-Background-Music"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-to-Choose-the-Right-Background-Music" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music"></a>Key Takeaways to Choose the Right Background Music</h2><p>Now that you’ve understood that how best background music for videos matters, Step one’s complete.

It is a technology that utilizes audio compression formats primarily for speech. A typical AMR speech codec will have a multi-rate of eight bitrate values that range from 4.75kb&#x2F;s to 12.2 kb&#x2F;s. The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.</p><p>In addition to compressing speech, the AMR file format can also be used for the storage of spoken audio using the same codec. There are a number of modern telephones that has the capability to store short audio recordings using the AMR format. There are also other programs, both free and proprietary that can be used to convert files from this format to other various formats and vice versa. However, since AMR file format was initially designed for storing speech or audio recordings, quality is likely to be compromised if other media files are converted into AMR.</p><h2 id="How-to-Open-AMR-files-on-PC-Smartphone-Tablet"><a href="#How-to-Open-AMR-files-on-PC-Smartphone-Tablet" class="headerlink" title="How to Open AMR files on PC&#x2F;Smartphone&#x2F;Tablet"></a>How to Open AMR files on PC&#x2F;Smartphone&#x2F;Tablet</h2><p>Though AMR file format was not designed for music and videos, there are certain instances when you might come across them and be confused on how to open them. The fact is that it is still possible to open AMR files with your personal computer, tablet, Smartphone or other devices.</p><p>In the case of a PC, the easiest way to open such a file is to simply double-click on it then allow the PC to decide which the most appropriate program to open it is.</p><p>If the already installed programs in your computer are unable to open the file, then the other alternative would be to search and download an appropriate AMR player. There are several sources from the internet that you can get such media player for absolutely free. If you prefer this route however, you need to be cautious and ensure that you don’t download a program file that will hurt your computer. Ensure that you download the program from a trusted website. This is the only to avoid downloading viruses, spyware, malware and other malicious programs that might compromise the safety and security of your computer.</p><h2 id="Convert-the-AMR-audio-file-to-another-Audio-format"><a href="#Convert-the-AMR-audio-file-to-another-Audio-format" class="headerlink" title="Convert the AMR audio file to another Audio format"></a>Convert the AMR audio file to another Audio format</h2><p>If you want to save yourself from risking your computer by installing other AMR players, you can simply convert the AMR audio file to other friendly formats whose player you already have.

VPN helps you access Omegle from a totally different location, making you a different individual to use Omegle. It masks your IP address and provides you with a virtual and temporary IP address to get access to Omegle. But there is a small disadvantage of using VPN, which is slow speed. If you plan to have video chats, this slow connection may hinder this process and get you to ban again for several drops. But you can simply refresh the VPN and access Omegle from a different location and get unbanned again.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Wait-for-some-time"><a href="#Wait-for-some-time" class="headerlink" title="Wait for some time"></a><strong>Wait for some time</strong></h4></li></ol><p>If you don’t want to use any trick to Omegle and wait for a few days, you should.

It allows you to access the websites from an intermediary IP address making it your temporary IP address. This method can get you unbanned from Omegle as many times as you want. The main difference between a Proxy and VPN is data encryption. The proxy doesn’t encrypt your data. Everything else is similar in both of the methods.</p><ol><li><h4 id="Use-a-Different-Network"><a href="#Use-a-Different-Network" class="headerlink" title="Use a Different Network"></a><strong>Use a Different Network</strong></h4></li></ol><p>Since the ban is not applied to the user, the IP address can simply be bypassed by changing the network you are using to access Omegle. Every network provides you with a different and Unique IP address. This could be anything, a mobile network, friend’s wifi, or public wifi. Changing the network can enable you to access Omegle immediately.

Filmed normally and then played backwards, this kind of videos can sometimes produce some amazing visual effects. If you want to know some pretty good videos that are played with video reversal, or backwards as some may call it, and learn from their creativeness so as to create one of your own, then you have certainly come to the right place. The following 5 videos top our list of the best backwards music videos.</p><h2 id="5-of-the-Best-Backwards-music-videos"><a href="#5-of-the-Best-Backwards-music-videos" class="headerlink" title="5 of the Best Backwards music videos"></a>5 of the Best Backwards music videos</h2><h3 id="1-Forward-by-Messe-Kopp"><a href="#1-Forward-by-Messe-Kopp" class="headerlink" title="1. Forward by Messe Kopp"></a>1. Forward by Messe Kopp</h3><p> This video was created by Messe Kopp and it is a perfect example of how backwards video techniques have evolved over recent years. It uses all the things that you would normally see in a backwards video and it really is a great video as well. You will also find that the backwards technique adds a complete new dynamic to the video as well so it really is interesting to watch. On top of this, the song is great and the whole scene works really well so you can already start to see how the backwards technique is becoming more and more prominent in today’s industry.</p><h3 id="2-2-Guys-600-Pillows"><a href="#2-2-Guys-600-Pillows" class="headerlink" title="2. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows"></a>2. 2 Guys, 600 Pillows</h3><p> Have you ever wondered what 600 pillows look like? Well now you know. The guys start by throwing pillows onto the bed and the great thing is that it is all in reverse. On top of this, it also shows the guys jump onto the pillows and the entire scene is reversed. The song that is played over the video is also great when you take a look at the way it is filmed so why not give it a watch for yourself to see the great filming styles that are present.</p><h3 id="3-Tongue-Tied"><a href="#3-Tongue-Tied" class="headerlink" title="3. Tongue Tied"></a>3. Tongue Tied</h3><p> This video is by a band called GroupLove and it was directed by Jordan Bahat. The video starts with a comical opening and after a few seconds you can start to see the backwards filming style. He starts by running backwards and before you know it, there are some wrestlers in masks following him. This video has plenty of things to show you and the effects are well and truly fantastic.</p><h3 id="4-Drop"><a href="#4-Drop" class="headerlink" title="4. Drop"></a>4. Drop</h3><p> This is called the Drop Video and it is by a group called the Pharcyde. Spike Jonze directed this and he came up with the idea for it as well. It has a very similar style to the first video and it is all filmed in the street. The group perform plenty of dance moves and this continues to add to the style and interest that this video has to offer.</p><h3 id="5-Rivers"><a href="#5-Rivers" class="headerlink" title="5. Rivers"></a>5. Rivers</h3><p> This video was done by a group called Small Feet and it really does have a lot to offer, from start to finish. Even though this video made it to number 5 on the list, doesn’t mean that it isn’t interesting. It was directed by Oskar Wrango and it uses nature in an attempt to tell the story of the song. This is unlike the videos that have been mentioned before and it certainly delivers an interesting result.</p><p> So there you have it, the top 5 backwards music videos. Some of them include more backward shots when compared to others but that doesn’t mean that they are any less interesting to watch. Some of them will blow you away and it just goes to show the amount of power and emotion that you can inject by simply using this technique in your own videos. Why don’t you give it a go for yourself today by seeing what you can accomplish? You’d be surprised at the results and it gives you a complete new canvas to work with as well so there are plenty of options available when choosing the overall theme and style.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-mastering-audio-clarity-techniques-for-eliminating-distortion-in-videos/"><u>New In 2024, Mastering Audio Clarity Techniques for Eliminating Distortion in Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-a-deep-dive-into-the-elegant-audio-editor-assessing-strengths-weaknesses-and-alternative-solutions/"><u>In 2024, A Deep Dive Into the Elegant Audio Editor Assessing Strengths, Weaknesses, and Alternative Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-safe-and-entertaining-directory-of-non-casual-social-networks/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Safe and Entertaining Directory of Non-Casual Social Networks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-enhance-your-recordings-noise-reduction-mastery-with-adobe-audition/"><u>In 2024, Enhance Your Recordings Noise Reduction Mastery with Adobe Audition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-quiet-edge-achieving-crystal-clear-video-through-smart-sound-editing-in-premiere-pro/"><u>2024 Approved The Quiet Edge Achieving Crystal-Clear Video Through Smart Sound Editing in Premiere Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/explore-the-sonic-depiction-of-a-bell-peal/"><u>Explore the Sonic Depiction of a Bell Peal</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-premiere-list-ultimate-voice-alteration-technology-for-drama-schools-2024/"><u>Updated Premiere List Ultimate Voice Alteration Technology for Drama Schools, 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-expert-guide-to-volume-control-in-audiovideo-content-for-2024/"><u>New Expert Guide to Volume Control in Audio/Video Content for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-google-play-location-on-samsung-galaxy-m34-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change Google Play Location On Samsung Galaxy M34 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/set-your-preferred-job-location-on-linkedin-app-of-your-itel-p40-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Set Your Preferred Job Location on LinkedIn App of your Itel P40 | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-unveiling-the-power-of-three-tiers-in-crafting-fb-ad-engaging-messages/"><u>[Updated] Unveiling the Power of Three Tiers in Crafting FB Ad Engaging Messages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-animate-your-memories-best-tools-for-easy-photo-animation/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved Animate Your Memories Best Tools for Easy Photo Animation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/apply-these-techniques-to-improve-how-to-detect-fake-gps-location-on-tecno-camon-20-pro-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Apply These Techniques to Improve How to Detect Fake GPS Location On Tecno Camon 20 Pro 5G | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-select-selections-elite-mac-video-grabbers-reviewed/"><u>In 2024, Select Selections  Elite Mac Video Grabbers Reviewed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-restore-missing-pictures-files-from-oppo-a1x-5g-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>How To  Restore Missing Pictures Files from Oppo A1x 5G.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-rapidly-rise-as-a-social-media-star-on-instagram/"><u>[New] In 2024, Rapidly Rise as a Social Media Star on Instagram</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-convert-mp3-to-mp4-like-a-pro-expert-advice-and-insights/"><u>Updated How to Convert MP3 to MP4 Like a Pro Expert Advice and Insights</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Your audio file must be saved in the MP3 format, you must have access to the podcast hosting platform, and you must be able to add a podcast to an RSS feed. The hosting platform you selected will utilize its RSS feed to distribute your podcasts to the apps and services your audience is using to listen to them and deliver a new episode of your show to your listeners as soon as you publish it. The reach of your podcasts, your monetization capabilities or whether or not you will be able to create custom domains depends on the podcast hosting platform you choose.</p><h3 id="What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits"><a href="#What-is-podcast-hosting-and-what-are-its-main-benefits" class="headerlink" title="What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?"></a>What is podcast hosting and what are its main benefits?</h3><p> All podcast hosting platforms let their users store their podcasts online and create an RSS feed for them that is used to add podcast to different podcast directories. Besides sending each new episode of your podcast to your subscribers, podcast hosting platforms also enable you to track their performance and learn which apps were used to access them as well as a plethora of other relevant metrics. Some podcast hosting platforms feature website builders that allow you to create custom domain landing pages, blogs or add widgets.</p><h3 id="Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#Why-do-I-need-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="Why do I need podcast hosting services?"></a>Why do I need podcast hosting services?</h3><p> Podcast hosting services simplify the process of storing and publishing podcasts and ensure that each new episode you publish reaches your subscribers. In addition, most platforms offer a quick and easy way to add tags, cover art or podcast descriptions, so that you can provide all the information your listeners need to find your podcasts effortlessly.</p><h3 id="How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform"><a href="#How-to-select-the-right-podcast-hosting-platform" class="headerlink" title="How to select the right podcast hosting platform?"></a>How to select the right podcast hosting platform?</h3><p> The reason why you are creating a podcast can often help you figure out which podcast hosting platform is the best option for you. If you would like to periodically share short interviews or simply have fun with your friends, then choosing a free version of a podcast hosting platform is your best option.</p><p> However, if you take podcasting seriously, finding out how much storage space a platform offers or the maximum bandwidth can help you decide if the platform you are considering is the right choice for you. Moreover, podcasters who also create video podcasts should check if the platform they would like to use to distribute their podcasts supports hosting and publishing video files. Ultimately, the amount of money you are willing to spend on subscription will determine which podcast hosting platform to pick since there is no reason to spend vast amounts of money on features you have no intention of using.</p><h3 id="Is-podcast-hosting-free"><a href="#Is-podcast-hosting-free" class="headerlink" title="Is podcast hosting free?"></a>Is podcast hosting free?</h3><p> Even though most podcast hosting platforms either have free versions or free trial, podcast hosting over an extended period of time is never free. Each platform offers different pricing options and lets you choose the one that is best suited for your needs. If you decide to publish your podcasts with a free version of the podcast hosting platform, you should keep in mind that the scope of your options is going to be limited.</p><h3 id="What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services"><a href="#What-is-the-average-cost-of-podcast-hosting-services" class="headerlink" title="What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?"></a>What is the average cost of podcast hosting services?</h3><p> The cost of a monthly subscription for a podcast hosting service can be anywhere between $7 and $99. The majority of basic and pro pricing plans can be purchased for less than $20, but if you would like to utilize all the features a podcast hosting platform has to offer, then your monthly subscription can cost much more than a hundred dollars. Lower priced options often lack advanced file-sharing tools or don’t provide integrations features, which is the reason why you should only consider them if you just need a quick way to publish a podcast.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each step of the process of creating a podcast is equally important, and the quality of the microphone you’re using to record an episode of your podcast is of no less significance than the hosting platform you’re using to publish a podcast.
