### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created.

The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song. For more studio-problem, please see this article: **[Practical Guide on How to Sync Audio and Video in Final Cut Pro X 2021](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).**

### 7.Quik – GoPro Video Editor

**Compatibility:** iOS 10.0 or later, Android 5.0 and up

![quik - software to sync video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/quik.JPG)

Quick’s audio library contains over a hundred songs you can use for free, and you can also import music from iTunes, Dropbox, iCloud Drive, or Google Drive into the app. Once your videos are synced to the beats of a song you can share them to Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, and various other social networks.

### 8\. [Beat Sync Maker](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/beat-sync-maker/id1434787464)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS 11.0 or later

Roland Corporation has manufactured some of the most iconic instruments in the history of electronic music, so it is no wonder that their Beat Sync Maker is one of the best apps DJs can use to create VJ-ing for their performances.

The maximum duration of a video you can export from the free version of this app is limited to just thirty seconds, and you must make an in-app purchase if you want to create longer videos with Beat Sync Maker.

### 9\. [Magisto](https://www.magisto.com/)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS 11.0 or later](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/magisto-video-editor/id486781045), [Android 5.0 and up](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magisto&hl=en), web-based

![magisto-upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magisto-upload.jpg)

Video content creators who don’t want to go through the video editing process every time they want to post a new video on social media should consider using Magisto. The app’s AI automatically merges photos or videos and creates the content you can share on social media in just a few minutes. Magisto lets you choose from different editing styles like Memories, Pets or Holidays, and enables you to import footage from the device’s gallery or from Google Photos. The app also grants you access to a huge music library of songs you can use free of charge, but it also allows you to import the music you want to use in a video. Magisto generates videos automatically and syncs the cuts to the beats of the song you selected. The only downside is that you are not going to have any control over how the videos are synced to the beats or make any changes after a video is generated.

**Conclusion**

Sound and music are often overlooked during the video editing process, which often reduces the quality of a video. A simple video editing technique like syncing the cuts with beats of a song can help you create dynamic videos that gather thousands of views, shares, and likes on social media. However, having the right sync video to music beat app is essential if you want to create professional-looking videos. Which app are you going to use to sync videos to the beats of a song?

### 2\. [Premiere Elements](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html)

**Price:** $59.99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Premiere Elements was created to simplify and automate the video editing process, which is the reason why syncing video clips to the beats of a song is a quick and easy process. You just have to add an audio file to the timeline and use the app’s Beat Detection feature to add markers to the song you selected. Customizing the settings of the Beat Detection option won’t take you much more than a few moments, but you should keep in mind that this tool is only available in the Expert view of the app. Furthermore, you can add new markers to an audio file from the Expert timeline by clicking on the Set Beat Marker icon if you want to make more cuts in your videos.

### 3\. [Cyberlink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/)

**Price:** $99,99

**Compatibility:** Windows

Cyberlink PowerDirector lets you detect beats and generate markers both automatically and manually, which enables you to choose the method that is best suited for the project you are working on. After you add an audio file to the app’s timeline, you should right-click on it and chose the Use Automatic Music Beat Detection option.

You can then set the minimum amount of time between two beat markers and click on the Detect button if you want to add markers automatically. Optionally you can also add markers during playback manually by clicking on the Add button or using the A keyboard shortcut. When done you should click on the Apply button in the Automatic Music Beat Detection dialogue box and beat markers are going to be added to the timeline automatically. Nonetheless, you must edit all video clips you want to add to your project manually.

### 4\. [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html)

**Price:** $20,99 as a single app

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows

Adobe Premiere Pro is much more than a simple sync video to music beat app because it is probably one of the most powerful video editing software products ever created. The process of editing a video to the beat of a song in Adobe Premiere Pro is a bit technical since you have to add all the markers to a sequence manually, set In and Out points for each clip you would like to add to the timeline, and automate that sequence so that the app can place your footage on the timeline in the order you selected. The BeatEdit extension can help you automate the process of adding beat markers to a sequence you created in Adobe Premiere Pro, but you must spend a hundred dollars on this extension if you want to generate markers automatically.

### 5\. [Final Cut Pro X](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/)

**Price:** $299,99

**Compatibility:** macOS

![FCPX - sync video to the beat of a song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/download-app.jpg)

There are several different ways to sync videos to the music beats in Final Cut Pro X, but this video editing software doesn’t allow you to add beat markers automatically. Installing the BeatMark X application will enable you to add markers to the audio file you want to use as a soundtrack of your video and create an XML file you can import into Final Cut Pro X. However, automating the process of adding the footage and creating the cuts isn’t possible, although the video editor lets you use generators that somewhat simplify this process. FCPX is a professional video editing software equipped with all the tools that are necessary to create a full-feature film, which makes it a bad and expensive choice for inexperienced video editors who are just looking for a quick way to sync their videos to the beat of a song.

So you're all set: you've sat down, grabbed your microphone, fired up your recording software, and started pouring out the content of your mind. Once finished, you listen back to the recording, thinking you're about to hear the silky-smooth undertones of your voice resonating through your ears, but something odd occurs — it sounds terrible. Distorted audio is very unwelcoming since you want the sound to be natural. This guide will explain how to fix distorted audio using various methods.

#### In this article

01 [What Causes Distorted Audio?](#part1)

02 [How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods](#part2)

## What Causes Distorted Audio?

Distorted audio is the main culprit in ruined audio clips. Here are some of the causes of distorted sound.

#### 1\. Recording Environment

Not recording dialogue and voice-over in a studio can cause distorted audio. However, audio quality can be out of control if you conduct an onsite interview. Getting a meaningful and cinematic shot should come first. If you do not use a studio-quality microphone that comes with directional controls, you'll likely have distorted audio. You might want to go for a unidirectional stereo channel if you want boom movements to be undetectable.

When a cheap, low-quality microphone is moving, you'll hear the unsteadiness in your recording, leading to distorted audio. Recording audio in an echo chamber or an overly large room can also result in distorted audio.

#### 2\. Touching the Mic While Recording

If you hand the microphone to someone who does not know how to use it, they might hold it too loosely or close. Microphones feature sensitive parts that should not be dropped, shaken, or breathed on. When you are interviewing people unfamiliar with industry standards, you should hold the microphone, not the person you are interviewing. The mic is not within the range of 6" to 12 " away from the speaker, this could lead to distorted audio.

#### 3\. Using the Wrong Mic

A reliable mic comes with audio controls and captures room tone and timbre. It should be portable, compact, and have a wind sleeve. In outdoor situations where ADR is not an option, you might want to use a wind sleeve.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

#### 4\. Positioning Your Microphones Incorrectly

You have to be careful if you'll be mounting a mic on your DSLR. Filming events with a one-mic setup is a promise to record everything you hear again. You'll inevitably film some moments at a distance and leave the audio compromised to distortion.

#### 5\. Faulty Equipment

Your equipment can fail in different ways. For instance, your effects processor can fail, meaning that you won't hear any sound passing through it. It can also fail, and you end up hearing a distorted sound passing out of the processor. Essentially, this might or might not be linked to the component's capability of handling the signal as much as the busted internals result.

## How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods

You can fix distorted audio using various methods. They include:

### Method 1: How To Fix Distorted Audio in Audacity

Audacity is the bread and butter for individuals who adore a crisp audio quality. Audacity helps users finetune various attributes of their recordings. It is a free and intuitive software suite suitable for newbies and individuals who don't interact with computers. With that in mind, here is how to fix distorted audio using Audacity.

1. Open the audio file by dragging and dropping it into Audacity.
2. Select the distorted part and click on the Effect option. Then, select Noise Reduction.

![fix distorted audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-1.png) ![how to fix distorted audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-2.png)

1. The Noise Reduction window will open.

![noise reduction in audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-3.png)

1. Now, click on Noise Profile, and Audacity will know what to filter out.
2. Next, select the entire audio and open the Noise Reduction Window again ( Effect > Noise Reduction ). Then, set the values to suit your preferences.
3. Hit preview to check the audio, then the Click OK button.

If the audio is still distorted, apply the filter again. Don't overdo the process numerous times to ensure your audio is not degraded, making the voice sound robotic and tinny.

Now, use compression to your advantage. If compression confuses you, think of it as a tool that adjusts your audio for the listener's benefit. Compression not only quiets the background minutiae that creeps into your recording, but it also boosts your voice and gives it a full, captivating resonance.

1. To start the compression process, select your audio track, press CTRL + A, click "Effect" and then click "Compressor."

![compress your audio with audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/how-to-fix-distorted-audio-4.png)

1. Adjust the values in the compressor to meet your needs and make your voice "pop" from the background.
2. Once you have set the values, hit the Preview button to check the audio. Then, click on OK.

That is how to fix distorted audio using Audacity.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

#### 4\. Positioning Your Microphones Incorrectly

You have to be careful if you'll be mounting a mic on your DSLR. Filming events with a one-mic setup is a promise to record everything you hear again. You'll inevitably film some moments at a distance and leave the audio compromised to distortion.

#### 5\. Faulty Equipment

Your equipment can fail in different ways. For instance, your effects processor can fail, meaning that you won't hear any sound passing through it. It can also fail, and you end up hearing a distorted sound passing out of the processor. Essentially, this might or might not be linked to the component's capability of handling the signal as much as the busted internals result.

So you're all set: you've sat down, grabbed your microphone, fired up your recording software, and started pouring out the content of your mind. Once finished, you listen back to the recording, thinking you're about to hear the silky-smooth undertones of your voice resonating through your ears, but something odd occurs — it sounds terrible. Distorted audio is very unwelcoming since you want the sound to be natural. This guide will explain how to fix distorted audio using various methods.

02 [How To Fix Distorted Audio Using Different Methods](#part2)

## What Causes Distorted Audio?

Distorted audio is the main culprit in ruined audio clips. Here are some of the causes of distorted sound.

#### 1\. Recording Environment

Not recording dialogue and voice-over in a studio can cause distorted audio. However, audio quality can be out of control if you conduct an onsite interview. Getting a meaningful and cinematic shot should come first. If you do not use a studio-quality microphone that comes with directional controls, you'll likely have distorted audio. You might want to go for a unidirectional stereo channel if you want boom movements to be undetectable.

When a cheap, low-quality microphone is moving, you'll hear the unsteadiness in your recording, leading to distorted audio. Recording audio in an echo chamber or an overly large room can also result in distorted audio.

#### 2\. Touching the Mic While Recording

If you hand the microphone to someone who does not know how to use it, they might hold it too loosely or close. Microphones feature sensitive parts that should not be dropped, shaken, or breathed on. When you are interviewing people unfamiliar with industry standards, you should hold the microphone, not the person you are interviewing. The mic is not within the range of 6" to 12 " away from the speaker, this could lead to distorted audio.

#### 3\. Using the Wrong Mic

A reliable mic comes with audio controls and captures room tone and timbre. It should be portable, compact, and have a wind sleeve. In outdoor situations where ADR is not an option, you might want to use a wind sleeve.

Podcast showrunners and content creators often use Blue Yeti mics connected to a soundboard. While these are cheaper options, they can cause distorted audio. Content creators who are not stationary should purchase a lavalier, and wireless is a more high-end and expensive option.

![sound forge vs audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/sound-forge-vs-audacity.jpg)

### What is Audacity?

[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) is free and open-source software developed by Dominic Mazzoni and Roger Dannenberg and released on May 28, 2000\. In April 2021, Muse group acquired the Audacity trademark but kept the application free and open source.

Audacity offers a great variety of features, such as a playback/record tool, editing options, and a wide range of effects that help professionals to adjust soundtracks, import and export audio files in any standard format, and analyze sound frequencies.

### Our Recommendations

Due to the advanced features and high scores on G2, we recommend using Audacity. However, other factors always come into play as the audio editing demands and needs change with time. So, **Sound Forge** can be a good option for you as a nomad in the music editing industry.

Most companies (with 50-200 employees and 1M-10M revenue) and the higher education industry in the United States are using Sound Forge.

On the other hand, businesses often use Audacity for marketing purposes, such as making Podcasts. The software can record audio for PowerPoint presentations to help visually impaired employees.
