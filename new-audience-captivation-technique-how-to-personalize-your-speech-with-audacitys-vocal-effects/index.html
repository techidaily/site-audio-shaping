How to Change Pitch in Audacity?</h2><p>Audacity, the audio voice changer, offers a ‘Change Pitch’ feature with which you can change the pitch of the audio without damaging its tempo. You can separately change the speed. With this feature, you can also adjust and play with the frequency and semitones.</p>
<p>The audio editor also features to estimate the starting pitch; for instance, if A3 is a quiet note, followed by a large and loud note like C4, Audacity will detect C4. In case both notes have the same volume, Audacity will detect A3. With Audacity, you also get the ‘To’ and ‘From’ controls if you plan to change the pitch manually. To learn more about changing pitch, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>Step 1: For changing pitch in Audacity, start by launching the software. After launching, you can either record the audio or else, from the ‘File’ section, you can also ‘Open’ any file from your device.</p>

How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?"></a>Part 3. How to Change Male Voice to Female Voice with Audacity?</h2><p>The most fun voice transformation is from low pitch to higher pitch. In general, modifying the male voice to a female voice, as the male pitch has a negative value and changing it to a positive pitch, modifies your voice to a female voice. What else could be better to use than the amazing Audacity voice changer? Let’s share the steps that will help you change your male voice to female.</p>
<p>Step 1: First, start by opening the Audacity audio editor. Once it has launched successfully, you should import the audio file. You can record audio with Audacity. Along with this, you can also import files from your device from the ‘File’ section, followed by the ‘Open’ option.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="upload audio track"
                ></p>
<p>Step 2: After your audio track is visible on the timeline, you have to select the part of the file that you want to edit. You can easily select it by clicking and dragging the mouse. If not this, you can also work with the whole track; for this, simply click on the track name to select it.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 3: After you are satisfied with the selection, head to the top menu and select the ‘Effects’ options. A drop-down list appears after this, and you have to look for the ‘Change Pitch’ option and select it.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.</p>
