## 5 Best Audio Editing Software to Add Audio to Video

#### 1\. WavePad from NCH Software

This is definitely one of the most popular editing tools because of how simple and easy it is to use. It is great for beginners who need professional-level editing tools. It is possible to use any audio format on this software including MP3, WMA, OGG, VOX, GSM, etc.

#### 2\. Audacity: Free open source audio editing software

This is free software that works on multiple platforms and supports multi-track editing and even live audio recording. It has a very simple user interface that makes it easy to learn on and get used to while offering professional features and ensuring the best quality.

**3\. Wondershare Filmora**

Users are not restricted to working across After Effects to manage their audios. There are a lot of options available in the market that feature simplicity and efficiency. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a unique example of such a platform that provides users with a simple user interface integrated with advanced features to work on. There are a lot of functions that can be performed across audio that is added across Filmora.

Multiple audio adjustment options are available across Wondershare Filmora. While fading the audio and managing its pitch, users can utilize denoising and ducking tools to make different edits across the audio.
