It has been a little over fifteen years since Ben Hammersley coined the term podcast. During this time, radio and TV stations, as well as people from all walks of life, have embraced this new medium of spreading information through either audio or video files.

Even though podcasts often have the form of a talk show, the topics podcasters cover in their shows range from presenting the latest music releases to discussing political topics. Listening to a podcast from a Smartphone without a player is not an option, which is why we made a selection of some of the best podcast player apps for iPhone and Android devices.

## Best Free Podcast Player Apps for iOS and Android Devices

Nearly all **podcast player apps** have similar features. You can discover new shows, limit how many episodes can be downloaded to your device or reduce silences to the very minimum.

The list of features a podcast player provides should help you determine if that app is the right choice for you. Here are some of the best free podcast player apps for iOS and Android devices you can find on the market in 2019.

### 1\. Breaker

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

Discovering new podcasts, **connecting with friends** who use Breaker or sharing the latest episode of the podcast you’re following on Facebook or Twitter is easy with this podcast player. Moreover, the app lets you see **which podcasts your friends like the most** so you can send them messages and start conversations about an episode you like.

Breaker enables you to create your own playlists and customize them in any way you want. The Sleep Timer feature can be useful if you're going to set up the episode playing time before your iPhone goes to the Sleep mode.

### 2\. Castbox

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:**[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/castbox-radio/id1243410543), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.castbox.audiobook.radio.podcast&hl=en)

Castbox lets you browse through million podcast episodes and choose from a variety of podcast genres. So, if you would like to follow the latest episodes of music and news related podcasts or talk shows, Castbox may be one of the best options on the market.

This cross-platform app is equipped with the tools that enable you to **adjust the audio playback speed**, trim silence or customize the sleep timer.

## How to Pick the Right Podcast Player App?

The majority of podcast players offer a similar set of options, which complicates the process of finding an app you can use to listen to podcasts on your Smartphones. The operating system your Smartphone supports or whether the app you’re considering offers podcast streaming options can influence your choice of a podcast player app.

Ultimately, the selection of shows and episodes an app offers, as well as its playback control options can help you determine which podcast player is the best option for you. In case you listen to podcasts on a daily basis, purchasing a monthly or annual subscription is a much better option than listening to podcasts with a free version of the app.

Below is a brief summary of the podcast player app listed above. Hope it can help to find out the best podcast app on your iPhone or Android phone.
