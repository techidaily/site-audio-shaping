## Part 1: What is audio ducking?

The concept of audio ducking is simple. In a soundtrack, you can find a wide range of music playing in the background. Audio ducking is the process of suppressing one type of audio signal and increasing the other movement simultaneously without causing any issues. Mostly audio ducking is processed for movies or any live sessions that reduce the background music when the characters or person speaks on the screen and increases the speaker's volume. The scenario happens vice versa when the speaker completes its conversation. Here, the background music increases, and the speaker's audio is reduced drastically. This type of audio ducking occurs to enhance the audio quality and reach the target audience without any issues.
