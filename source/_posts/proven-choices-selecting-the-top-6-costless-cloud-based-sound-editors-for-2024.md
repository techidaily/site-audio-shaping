## Navigating TikTok's Volume Settings: Essential Methods for Quiet Videos

TikTok provides some enjoyment, comfort, and inside jokes, contributing to developing a sense of community among its users.

However, you probably wouldn't have needed to learn **how to mute audio in TikTok** two or three years ago, but we're now living in one of the most turbulent periods in human history, so it's a skill that's become more critical.

When you upload specific popular music files to TikTok, you won't be able to publish the video or find it muted because of the copyright restrictions placed on the audio files. So, how will you turn off the music on TikTok and choose a different soundtrack to listen to? Naturally, you may directly alter the audio level in TikTok.
