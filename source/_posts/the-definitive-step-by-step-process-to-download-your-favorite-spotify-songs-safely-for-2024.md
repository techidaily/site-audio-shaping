### 1\. Freesound

This site has thousands of sound effects available under the Creative Commons 0 license. This means that they can be used for any purpose, personal or commercial, without attribution or permission required. To download music from Freesound, follow these steps.

**Step 1:** Go to the Freesound website.

### 2\. Incompetech

This site offers royalty-free music and sound effects used in a commercial or non-commercial project. All of the sounds are available for download in MP3 format.

**Step 1:** First of all, go to Incompetech and open up any page on the site. You'll see that there are links on the left side.

**Step 2:** Click on one of those links, and you'll see a list of songs of that category. Once again, click on one of the songs to open up another page where you can listen to it.

**Step 3:** Once you're done listening, scroll down, and you'll see a link that says "Download this song". Click on the link, and it will start downloading automatically.

**Step 4:** Once downloaded, go into your project and put in the music track where you want the song to go in. If you want a song to be longer, re-download the song and find that "Download this song" link again. Put it where you want the new end of the music to be.

![download this song](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/incompetech.JPG)

### 3\. Orange Free Sounds

This site offers various sound effects that are free to download and use in your projects. The sound effects are available in MP3 format and can be used for personal or commercial purposes. Here is how to download a video from orange free sounds step by step.

**Step 1:** Go to the URL of the video. The URL is the address of the video that you want to download. Copy it and paste it in a new tab or window if your browser doesn't automatically do it for you.

**Step 2:** The next step is to go to a website called SaveFrom.net. When the page has loaded, look for the big blue button that says "Download Video". A new tab or window will open with the download page. It would be best to paste the video URL in the "Enter a video URL" bar.

**Step 3:** After pasting it, click on "Download this video" (the blue button). When it appears, press on one of them. I usually go for mp3 format because it keeps good quality and it's the most used format that you can play on many devices.
