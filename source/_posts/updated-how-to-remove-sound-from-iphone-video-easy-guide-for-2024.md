### Step 3: Record and add your voiceover to video

Instead of [adding music to the video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can also record and add voiceover to the video. It's a fun way to add narration or complementary audio to video. To do so, click the Record button on the toolbar above timeline, the Record dialog will appear.

Click the red Record button, and you can start to talk in 3 seconds. The voiceover will be added to the User's Album and timeline when completed.

### Step 4: Replace audio track of the video

This is similar to adding audio to video. Just an extra step is required: delete the original audio file. To do so, right-click the video you want to replace audio in it, and select [Audio Detach](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). After that, delete the audio file from the track.

As described above, you can then drag and drop a new audio file from User's Album to the Audio track.

### Step 5: Adjust the audio file and be creative

Various audio editing tools are available: set volume, speed up, slow down, change pitch and add fade in/out effect. Double-click the audio file on the timeline to change the settings and drag the slide bar.

Hit "Return" to confirm the settings and go back to the main interface.

### Step 6: Export video with new audio track

Click "Create" and select "Format" when all is ready. From the list, choose any format you want as the output format. If necessary, also change the advanced settings. Finally, click the "Create" button to export a new video file to the specified folder on the computer.

Besides export video to your computer, you can also create video for devices like the iPhone, iPad, iPod, directly upload video to YouTube, or burn it to DVD for playing on TV. All in one video editor, no extra software required.
