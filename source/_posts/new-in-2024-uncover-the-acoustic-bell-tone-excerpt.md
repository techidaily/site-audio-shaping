![load 3xosc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).

![vol subtab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant

## Part 1 Ways to Download Various Sound Effects

There are many ways to download or get various sound effects including bell sound effects.

These sounds on the sites have been recorded professionally and thus you will not be finding any noises or other disturbing effects while you are matching them with your videos.

Here are some of the ways where you can download all kinds of sound effects that are free to use.

### 1\. Download from Some YouTube Video

As YouTube doesn’t allow downloading videos directly to your device all the time unless the video owner allow it, you need to use third party websites that allows users to convert YouTube videos into MP3 files. MP3FY is an awesome website that will allow you to download the audio part of the YouTube video that you want to download. Here is how you can do it.

**Step 1:** First you need to visit MP3FY website from your computer browser.

**Step 2:** Next you need to copy the video link from YouTube and paste the link into the box.

**Step 3:** Then click on the Convert button and click Confirm after that so that you can verify the video.

**Step 4:** Finally you need to click on the Download MP3 button to Save the MP3 file to your computer, where you can play it in your favorite music player or simply use it to add into any video of your choice.

![mp3fy web](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-3.png)

Another way to download audio from YouTube video is by converting a video to MP3 directly from YouTube. Here is how.

**Step 1:** First you need to add the letters fy between youtube and .com in the URL for the YouTube video you want to convert.

**Step 2:** This will take you to the MP3FY website, where you need to follow the same steps like before to convert and download the MP3 file.

### 2\. Make Bell Sound Effect by Yourself

If you have FL Studio and 3xOSC plugin then you can easily create bell sounds mp3 effect by yourself. The process is a bit technical but we’ll get you through this process step by step.

**Step 1:** First you need to load 3xOsc to your FL Studio project and choose Sine Wave as the shape for the Oscillator 1\. Also, for this process, we’ll only need ONE oscillator so disable the Osc 2 & Osc 3 by turning their volume levels to 0%.

![load 3xosc](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-6.jpg)

**Step 2:** Next you need to navigate to the “Instrument Properties (INS)” tab and from there select “VOL” subtab (volume envelope) and click on the “Use envelope” button to enable it. Then you need to edit the envelope curve to look like below image (short Attack time, quite low Sustain level and semi-long Release time is the key here).

![vol subtab](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-7.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, you need to click on the “TNS” button (Tension) to edit the envelope line shapes a bit. We need to lower the tension level of Decay to add sharper “drop” from the Decay to Sustain. This will make the bell sound sharper for you. Also lower the tension level between Sustain and Release so that it doesn’t let the long Release to be too dominant

![tns button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/bell-sound-8.jpg)

**Step 4:** Finally, you need to add that spacious depth and color to the sound via Fruity Reeverb. So, you can assign the 3xOsc to a free mixer track and drop a Fruity Reeverb to its effect slot. You need to set it like – “Color to Warmer (all the way to right – to make the reverb sound less metallic), Decay to 7 sec (long Decay time is the key here to make the bell sound huge and atmospheric), HighDamping to OFF and Reverb level to 24%”.

## Using the LAME Library to Convert Audacity Files to MP3 format

What is the best course of action? Aside from those mentioned above simple Wondershare technique, we recommend converting aup3 to mp3 using the LAME library, which can be found in the LAME library. In case you don't know, audacity seems to be a free multiplatform computer tool that can be used to record and edit audio and convert files to MP3 format. If it is compatible with the LAME library, which is an MP3 encoder, it will enable you to export Audacity files as MP3\. The conversion method generally consists of downloading the LAME library & converting the Audacity file to MP3 2 characteristics using the LAME library.

**Note:**

• Audacity does not have the ability to immediately encode or save Audacity files; you must first download and install the LAME library.

### 1.Download LAME Library

* To download the appropriate version of LAME, go to the LAME library website & choose your computer system from the drop-down menu, then click Open.

![download-lame-library-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-library-poster.png)

* Now choose the location where you want the file stored & click on Save to begin the download. You may also rename the file, but keep in mind that this sort of file is a compressed folder, so it's best to preserve it in its original format.

![download-lame-library-poster2](https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-library-poster2.png)

* When the downloading process is complete, just unzip the files as you would normally.

![download-lame-library-poster3](https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-library-poster3.png)

**Tips:** Alternatively, if you're using Windows Vista, we suggest that you open the file in the explorer window, select it, and then click on Extract All Files from the command bar to see the contents of the extracted folder.

![download-lame-library-poster4](https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-library-poster4.png)

### 2.Converting Audacity files to MP3 format

**Step 1:** Due to the fact that this is your first time using audacity, you will be prompted to identify the location where you have stored the LAME library file.

Select file> Export as MP3 from the menu bar and select where you want to save the file in audacity.

**Step 2:** Then, choose where you want to store your file & rename it any way you like; now, leave Save as type: MP3 files as the only option available.

![convert-audacity-mp3-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/convert-audacity-mp3-step2.png)

**Step 3:** After clicking on Save, you will be presented with a dialogue asking for your permission; choose Yes to start with the process of saving Audacity files as MP3.

![convert-audacity-mp3-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/convert-audacity-mp3-step3.png)

**Step 4:** You must open the MP3 file in audacity and modify it by adding some particular information such as the artist (optional) and selecting OK to confirm saving as MP3 in Audacity. After that, the project will be exported, transformed, and the audacity files will be saved as MP3 files.

![convert-audacity-mp3-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/convert-audacity-mp3-step4.png)

That's all there is to it! You should now be able to export aup3 to mp3 format. But because of patent and licensing difficulties, LAME codes aren't usually included with audacity when exporting files to Audacity mp3\. LAME codes are alson't always included when exporting files to MP3\. For the sake of conclusion, after we have done editing a project in audacity, we will need to convert it to MP3 format for future convenience. However, you may download it individually for free by following the above methods. Furthermore, Wondershare UniConverter is a fantastic solution with comprehensive capabilities that can assist you in finishing your audacity audio recording projects and saving them as Audacity mp3 files in audacity, among other things.
