* Split Screen Functionality: This is a highly useful feature that comes in handy when you have multiple videos on your hands that you can play at the same time. You just need to select the split-screen icon on the home menu, and select as many numbers of screens you want, and in any particular order you need.
* Audio Separation: This is one of the key features of Filmora that makes it stand out from its competitors. As the name suggests, this feature lets you separate any audio clip from a video, and then save it as a file that can further be added to another video.
* Social Import: Filmora understands the modern trends, and provides options to directly import videos from social media channels, edit it, add sound effects and then upload it back to social media within no time. This saves you from a lot of hassle of downloading the video first and makes your job easier.
