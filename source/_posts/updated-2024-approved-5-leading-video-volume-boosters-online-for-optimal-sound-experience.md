## Part 1\. What Should Be Considered Before Choose a Sound Editor?

There are various sound editors available. We are here to help you by sharing different factors that should be considered to select a better sound editing app. Let’s start!

### 2\. Plugins and Add On

While selecting your sound editing app, check its behavior with other apps. This is because editing software expands with additional features, sounds, and other plugins and add-ons. Some of these are free, whereas some are costly.

### 3\. Operating System and Pricing

One important thing that should be checked is your device’s compatibility with the sound editor. What so ever device and operating system you use, make sure it works with your device. Lastly, remember one thing, editing like professionals do not require tons of money. It's essential that you wisely select an affordable editor.

### 4\. Editing Features

A sound editor should contain a mixture of basic and advanced editing features across its platform. It should include features such as the ones provided as follows:

* Audio Tracks: A good sound editor should at least support playing three audio tracks simultaneously in addition to the sound of the main audio track.
* Volume Control: Apart from this, an ideal sound editing software should also enable volume control for different parts of the video project.
* Normalization: Among the different features, one very noticeable feature that sound editing apps must have is Normalization. The feature automatically adjusts all the different volume levels of various sounds into balance.
* Auto Music: Auto music is the next editing feature we are going to share. This feature helps to make the length of the stock library audio according to your project length.
* Noise Filter: What do you think about noise filters? They are essential as in case of any recording that has background noise; these filters can do the magic.

### 5\. Export Audio
