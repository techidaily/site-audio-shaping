In today’s world of modern gaming, voice chat has become a standard tool. Only a gamer can understand the importance of communicating with the team members to be ahead of the game. With technological advancements, some of the new games have inbuilt voice-communication, but their quality and services are not that good. So, if you are in search of some great **gamer chat apps,** then this article will help you find some of the best **gaming voice chat apps** from a number of choices available on the internet, alongside their advantages and disadvantages.

Here are the seven best **gaming voice chat apps** for your gaming communication obstacles.

### 1\. [Mumble](https://www.mumble.com/)

Available on: Android, iOS, macOS, Windows and Linux

This voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) application speaks for itself. Mumble has made its mark among the best voice chat applications for gamers with a free and open-source platform, ensuring encryption support that is concerned to protect the data across the servers. This platform has been considered an efficient choice for swift gaming across Windows, Mac, and Linux, forging low-latency communication.

Mumble features a controlled environment for the users, conforming to a server version that can be bought for as low as $7.50/month, catering 15 slots in total. Mumble emphasizes middleware, allowing additional features across the platform for extending the experience in voice chat gaming. You can visit this page <https://www.mumble.info/downloads/> to download this app.

**Pros:**

Known among the **best voice chat app for gaming,** Element provides gamers with a state-of-the-art user interface combined across a very progressive experience of voice chatting with friends while gaming. Formerly known as Riot, this platform integrates a free and distinctive voice and video conferencing experience for enhanced communication.

### 3\. Discord

Discord has been regarded as the most trusted and recommended voice chat app across the gaming community for efficient VoIP service. This application has provided gamers with the basic abilities for chatting with other Discord members through text, voice, or group chat. Discord provides a free service to its user with the ability to video or text chat with a channel having a maximum of 10 users.
