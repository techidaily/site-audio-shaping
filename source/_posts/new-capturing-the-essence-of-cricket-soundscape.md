## Elevating Your Video Projects with Audio Synchronization in Magix Pro

# How to add Audio to Video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Having a perfect soundtrack to your videos is as important as having a perfectly captured footage, because the music and sounds you add to your videos, set the atmosphere of the video. Choosing the right music and atmospheric sounds to match the action taking place in the video is an important task that shouldn't be taken lightly since the video's reception by the audience depends on it. Failing to lip-sync or to add a knocking sound when someone is entering the room will reduce the realism of your film and break the illusion you tried so hard to create.

 Let's have a look at how you can add and remove audio files to video using Magix Movie Edit Pro video editing software.

## How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

 Before deciding to remove the audio file that was recorded together with the video clip, make sure that you already have sounds and music that will replace it. Having the audio recordings that match your video perfectly is of utmost importance because if you add files that don't match the video the final result will be barely watchable.

#### 1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio

![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-ungroup.JPG)

 All video clips also contain an audio file, that isn't displayed on the Magix Movie Edit Pro's timeline until the two files are separated. In order to separate the audio and video file, you need to select the video file you placed on the timeline, by dragging it from the 'Import' tab and dropping it on the video track and then click on the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's timeline.

#### 2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track

 After clicking on the 'Ungroup' icon, you will be able to see an audio file on the editor's audio track. If you would like to remove it from the project entirely, select the audio file and click on the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to keep parts of the original audio track, select the file, place the playhead at the position in the file where you would like to make the cut and then click on the 'Split objects' icon on the toolbar. Repeat the same action at the position where you would like the sound file to end.

 Adding new audio files to your project is simple, because all you need to do is head over to the 'Import' tab, locate the files you want to use in your video on your hard-drive and drag and drop them onto the audio track. Cut out the parts of the audio file you don't want to use by clicking on the ''Split objects' icon and make sure that the length of the audio matches the length of the video.

#### 3.Edit the audio files

![magix-size-position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/magix-audio-effects.JPG)

 Magix Movie Edit Pro offers a large number of audio effects that can help you create a better soundtrack for your video. Click on the 'Effects' tab and slide down to the 'Audio Effects' section where you can adjust the volume, clean the background noises in the audio or apply some of many audio effects located under the 'Audio Effects' option. Additional audio effects can be purchased at the Magix Movie Edit Pro's store, but some of the effects can be pricey for consumer-level video editors.

 If you would like to merge the freshly created audio file with the video file after you applied all the audio effects you wanted, simply click on the 'Group' icon, located next to the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's toolbar.

## Alternative Way of Adding Audio to a Video

 Even though adding audio files to videos isn't such a complicated process in Magix Movie Edit Pro, you might still consider using a video editing software that provides more options for audio editing. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) will enable you to split, trim, add or remove audio files from your project in just a few simple steps. The software also gives you access to numerous royalty free music tracks that can be used in videos created with Filmora. Producing great visual content with Filmora video editing software is a simple process that can be completed in a short period of time, due to the abundance of the editing tools that make the editing process fast and easy.

 Having a perfect soundtrack to your videos is as important as having a perfectly captured footage, because the music and sounds you add to your videos, set the atmosphere of the video. Choosing the right music and atmospheric sounds to match the action taking place in the video is an important task that shouldn't be taken lightly since the video's reception by the audience depends on it. Failing to lip-sync or to add a knocking sound when someone is entering the room will reduce the realism of your film and break the illusion you tried so hard to create.

 Let's have a look at how you can add and remove audio files to video using Magix Movie Edit Pro video editing software.

## How to add audio to video in Magix Movie Edit Pro

 Before deciding to remove the audio file that was recorded together with the video clip, make sure that you already have sounds and music that will replace it. Having the audio recordings that match your video perfectly is of utmost importance because if you add files that don't match the video the final result will be barely watchable.

#### 1.Import the video clip and separate the video and audio

 All video clips also contain an audio file, that isn't displayed on the Magix Movie Edit Pro's timeline until the two files are separated. In order to separate the audio and video file, you need to select the video file you placed on the timeline, by dragging it from the 'Import' tab and dropping it on the video track and then click on the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's timeline.

#### 2.Remove and replace the files on the audio track

 After clicking on the 'Ungroup' icon, you will be able to see an audio file on the editor's audio track. If you would like to remove it from the project entirely, select the audio file and click on the 'Delete' button on your keyboard. However, if you would like to keep parts of the original audio track, select the file, place the playhead at the position in the file where you would like to make the cut and then click on the 'Split objects' icon on the toolbar. Repeat the same action at the position where you would like the sound file to end.

 Adding new audio files to your project is simple, because all you need to do is head over to the 'Import' tab, locate the files you want to use in your video on your hard-drive and drag and drop them onto the audio track. Cut out the parts of the audio file you don't want to use by clicking on the ''Split objects' icon and make sure that the length of the audio matches the length of the video.

#### 3.Edit the audio files

 Magix Movie Edit Pro offers a large number of audio effects that can help you create a better soundtrack for your video. Click on the 'Effects' tab and slide down to the 'Audio Effects' section where you can adjust the volume, clean the background noises in the audio or apply some of many audio effects located under the 'Audio Effects' option. Additional audio effects can be purchased at the Magix Movie Edit Pro's store, but some of the effects can be pricey for consumer-level video editors.

 If you would like to merge the freshly created audio file with the video file after you applied all the audio effects you wanted, simply click on the 'Group' icon, located next to the 'Ungroup' icon on the editor's toolbar.

## Alternative Way of Adding Audio to a Video

 Even though adding audio files to videos isn't such a complicated process in Magix Movie Edit Pro, you might still consider using a video editing software that provides more options for audio editing.
