## 5 Best Audio Editing Software to Add Audio to Video

#### 1\. [WavePad from NCH Software](https://www.nch.com.au/wavepad/index.html)

#### 2\. [Audacity: Free open source audio editing software](https://www.audacityteam.org/)

This is free software that works on multiple platforms and supports multi-track editing and even live audio recording. It has a very simple user interface that makes it easy to learn on and get used to while offering professional features and ensuring the best quality.

**3\. Wondershare Filmora**

Users are not restricted to working across After Effects to manage their audios. There are a lot of options available in the market that feature simplicity and efficiency. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a unique example of such a platform that provides users with a simple user interface integrated with advanced features to work on. There are a lot of functions that can be performed across audio that is added across Filmora.

Multiple audio adjustment options are available across Wondershare Filmora. While fading the audio and managing its pitch, users can utilize denoising and ducking tools to make different edits across the audio.

To add audio in Wondershare Filmora, you need to follow the steps as explained below.

**Step 1: Start a New Project on Wondershare Filmora**

Download and install the official software of Wondershare Filmora on your device. Once installed, you need to launch it and tap on “New Project” to start working on Filmora.

**Step 4: Export Audio File**
