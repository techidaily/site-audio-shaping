Some of the greatest film directors of all time have used sound to make the scenes in their movies more dramatic, romantic or to build suspense. The importance of sound for the overall quality of a video is often overlooked by young filmmakers, as they tend to dedicate all of their attention to the visual part of their projects.

The fact of the matter is that even a minor error in the video’s soundtrack can distract the viewer and ruin a video completely. That’s why, in this article, we are going to show you four different methods of adjusting the audio volume in Filmora.

## Four Ways of Adjusting Audio Volume in Filmora

The audio clips often have different volume levels, so in order to create a balanced soundtrack, you have to adjust the volume of each audio track you intend to use in your projects. Filmora offers several different ways to adjust the volume of audio files quickly and effortlessly. Here’s how you can increase or decrease the volume of the audio clips in Filmora.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 1. Changing the Audio Volume of Entire Track

This is probably the easiest and fastest way to adjust the volume of a video or an audio file in Filmora. After you import the file into a project you just have to add it to a certain position on the timeline. You can do this by simply dragging and dropping the file at the location on the timeline where you want the file to be placed. Click on the **Add Track menu** that is located in the upper left corner of the timeline and select the **Big option** from the **Adjust Track Height** submenu.

Enlarging the video and audio tracks will enable you to see the **audio volume line** that is displayed over all clips that contain sound you add to the timeline. **Click on the line and drag it upwards if you would like to increase the volume or drag it downwards if you want to decrease the volume of an audio or a video file.**

#### 2. Applying the Fade In and Fade Out Effects to Change the Audio Volume Partially

Once you add an audio clip to an audio track on Filmora’s timeline, you can adjust its volume from the **Audio Editing panel.** Double-clicking on an audio file will bring up the Audio Editing panel that contains **Fade In and Fade Out** sliders. Both sliders are going to be set to zero by default, so you just have to drag each of them to the right in order to create the Fade In or Fade Out effect.

Filmora also lets you create the Fade In and Fade Out effect directly from the timeline, as you just have to **hover** **the mouse over an audio file and drag the Fade In or Fade Out markers** to set the duration of the effect for that particular file.

#### 3. Using the Volume Slider to Change the Audio Volume

On the left side of the Audio Editing panel that can be accessed by double clicking on an audio file, you will be able to see the **volume slider.** Its value is going to be set to **0 dB** by default and you just have to **drag it upward or downward** in order to adjust the audio volume. As you drag the slider the new audio volume value is going to be displayed in a box below the slider. The **left/right balance value** can be adjusted by **dragging the knob** that is located above the volume slider in either direction. Alternatively, you can **insert a new numerical value in the box** below the knob. If the displayed value is **0 dB, then the left and right channels are balanced**, while the value of **\-100 dB** means that all the sound goes through the left channel and if the displayed value is **100 dB** all the sound will go through the right channel.

![stereo-mode](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/stereo-mode.jpg)

#### 4. Adding Keyframes to Adjust the Audio Volume

Once you add an audio file to the timeline you can adjust its volume by **adding keyframes** to it. **Place** **the playhead to the exact spot in the audio file** where you want to add the first keyframe and then **double click on the file to bring up the Audio Editing panel**. Click on the **Add Volume Keyframes** icon and **use the volume slider to adjust the volume** at the position of the first keyframe.

![animation-customize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animation-customize.jpg)

Simply **move the playhead and change the value on the volume slider** to add new keyframes to the audio file. This method of adjusting audio volume enables you to set different volume values for different parts of an audio file.[](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Just as you can probably guess by its name, iMovie is a video editor made by Apple which is available on almost all of its devices. This means that you can have a similar editing experience on your iPhone, iPad, iMac, and more. While this software is not ideal for any kind of advanced and large scale video editing projects, it is certainly more than enough for adding music to video files. Despite lacking video effects or other advanced features, you do get basic options like trimming, cutting, cropping, adding music, adding text, and other basic yet important features. Hence, if you want to learn how can I put music over a video on any of your Apple devices for completely free, then you can go through these steps and instructions:

### #3) Put Music under video with Premiere Pro

![premiere pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/add-music-pr-2.png)

When compared with other video editors out there, Premiere Pro by Adobe is used for all kinds of large scale products including Hollywood movies and TV shows. This is due to the reason that Adobe Premiere offers every possible feature that you can ever want in a video editor. Even though Adobe Premiere Pro is not free to use, it is still a great option for many users who want to edit videos more than just adding music files. Whether it is advanced video effects, plugins support, automated editing, extensive media support, color grading options, VFX support, compatibility with other Adobe tools, sound design, or anything else, Adobe Premiere Pro offers it all. As a result, if you want to use Premiere Pro for adding music to video files, then it can be done quite easily as described here:

● Even though the user interface of Adobe Premiere Pro can be a little intimidating, adding music in it is still quite easy.

● To start, go to the Media Browser in Adobe Premiere Pro to find and browse your desired music tracks.

● You can then right click on a music track and select Import to get the music track in the media library.

● Finally, you can open the Media Library and drag this music track onto your timeline where it can be moved under any video of your choice.

● If you want, you can select the music track and go to the Effects Control window to change the volume levels, pitch, keyframes, and apply all other kinds of music effects before saving your video with music under it.

### #4) How to Put Music Over Video Online?

![ online editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/music-editor-1.png)

In case you just want to add music to video files without using or applying any more effects, then you don’t need to install any programs on your computer. Instead, you can use one of the various online video editors for putting music over videos. Such video editors are completely free and do not use your computer’s processor which makes them great for entry level computers which cannot run heavy video editing programs. Most of these online video editors are also quite easy to use with basic and simple user interfaces making them great for beginners. You can also put music over videos online using such video editors by going through this step by step guide:

● First, open the [Audio to Video Tool by Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/add-audio-to-video) in any web browser of your choice.

● Now, choose the video file and the audio file that you want to combine together into a single media file.

● You can also change settings like the position of the audio, its volume level, mute the video file, and many others.

● Once all settings are changed to your preferences, you can click on Add to save the video with music added to it.

### #5) How to Put Music in Kinemaster?

![kinemaster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/video-app-4.jpg)
