## Part 3\. Remove Wind Noise From Video On iPhone/Android With iMovie App

### [iMovie App for Android and iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193)

With iMovie, you can edit videos on your Mac, iPhone, or iPad in a simple and intuitive manner. You can use it to create videos with multiple effects, color corrections, stabilisations, and audio enhancements. It is easy for users to create cutaways, use blue/green screens, or apply split screens or picture-in-pictures.

An equalizer and an audio filter are built into the Mac version of iMovie to reduce noise. Make sure your setup does not remove the voice as well. In contrast, the iPhone requires the audio to be detachable or the volume to be reduced.
