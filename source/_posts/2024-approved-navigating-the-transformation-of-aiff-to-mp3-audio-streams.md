## A Comparative Study of Prospective Mac MP3 Management Programs

Some people love to collect and organize songs, and they are addicted to creating music libraries. Are you one of them? If you are, you must know how things are organized, but if you have never organized a music library, let's tell you how it's done. ID3 tags are used to store information. You can use the tags and store the artist's name, song name, genre, and whatever you want.

You might organize music according to artist or dates; however, you like it. The problem arises when you don't have correct information stored in the tags. For this reason, Mac MP3 tag editors are used. If you are a Mac user, who wants to edit tags, let's provide you with a list of the best Mac music tag editors. Let’s get started!

#### In this article

01 [What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor?](#part1)

02 [5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor](#part2)

## Part 1\. What Need to Be Considered Before Choosing a Mac MP3 Tag Editor

Have you ever looked at the internet and the number of options you get whenever you search for MP3 tag editor Mac free? The page is all packed and loaded with tons of different options. No doubt it's tough to select a good tag editor, but what if we tell you some tricks for selecting a great Mac music tag editor? Without any further delay, let’s begin.

### · Easy to User Interface

A primary factor that is considered while selecting any tool, the editor, is its interface. If any software offers a complex interface, users don't prefer it. An easy interface means all the editing, manipulating, adding, deleting options appear on the front. Users don't have to struggle to find basic options.

### · Online Database Search

If any macOS MP3 tag editor offers an online database search means it’s a good editor. This is because not all editors support online search. The option is very helpful as the online search shares all the information related to any searched tag.

### · Editing Options

How many editing options do you prefer? Editing metadata means that you should be able to edit and manipulate as many fields as possible. For instance, the Mac music tag editor should allow changing the singer's name, year tag, and all the other fields.

### · Batch Processing

Editing is a stressful and hectic job. Is there a way to help yourself? Let’s share about Batch Processing. If the Mac MP3 tag editor allows batch processing, then it's a great choice. This is because editing individually can take hours, but batch processing reduces the editing time as well as the editing efforts.

### · Supported Formats

How many formats can your Mac music tag editor support? Although all the tools are MP3 tag editors, not all audio files have MP3 format. For this reason, always select the tag editor that can support and edit different files formats.

## Part 2\. 5 Recommended Mac MP3 Tag Editor

After talking about the options to consider before selecting any macOS MP3 tag editor, it’s the perfect time to share some tag editors with all the Mac users. So, let's talk about the 5 best tag editors without any further delay.

### 1\. [Wondershare UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

Wondershare UniConverter is a great choice as a Mac MP3 tag editor. This software can be used for multiple purposes. UniConverter is amazing as it can download and record files from various sites. An extra thing, Wondershare UniConverter can also convert files to different formats.

It’s all fun when recording and posing for great videos, not until you realize that the quality of the sound is far below your expectations, the joy derived fades off and you seek ways in which to perfect the quality of sound. Whenever you rely on the microphone of your camera, the sound recorded may be similar to that of someone mumbling in a cave. When the sound is of importance to you just like the images are, it is worth investing in an experienced audio producer to help the muffled sounds be much cleaner and clear. Generally, the biggest reason as to why one would want to improve the audio quality is to give presentable videos with clear audios and benefit from them.

## FAQs

### 1\.  How can I make my sound louder in Filmora?

It is a really easy method that you do not need to go into detailed study to learn how to make the sound louder.

Let us start:

* Open Filmora and import your audio.
* Drag the audio into the timeline in the audio layer.
* Now click on the audio in the timeline, and you will find a blue line inside this layer.
* Drag that blue line up and down, you will find when you go up the volume will become louder and when you drag the audio down the volume will be lower.

### 2\. How can I remove background noise from recordings in Filmora?

![noise1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/09/noise1.png)

* First of all, click on the **de-noise** feature to remove the background noise from the audio.

Usually, when you increase the volume of your audio the noise in the background will also increase so this feature is very important.

* Now click on the **auto normalization**, this will help to level up the volume of the audio.  
While making audio, we have different tones of the volume. Sometimes we speak loud with more energy and sometimes we have low volume and this auto normalization feature will help to adjust the level of the whole audio.  
In this latest version of Filmora, we have two more features that are **wind removal** and hum removal.
* Click on the **hum removal**, it removes the humming noise in the recorded audio.
* Click on the **wind removal**, it automatically removes the sound of the wind which will make your audio clear.
* Finally, press **Ok**.
