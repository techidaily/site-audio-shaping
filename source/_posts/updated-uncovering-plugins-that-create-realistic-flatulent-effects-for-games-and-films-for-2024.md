### 5\. [Steinberg Cubase](https://new.steinberg.net/cubase/)

Cubase has been the best hip-hop DAW in the market ever since digital music production became a reality. Despite being one of the oldest digital audio workstations, Steinberg Cubase has everything you’ll need to compose and mix a hip-hop track.

Recently, the company released Steinberg Cubase version 10, which focuses on automation over everything. With several built-in plugins, you can expect a quick workflow. Also, Cubase offers a user-friendly interface, making it easier to navigate through different features.

**Pros**

### 6\. [Acoustica](https://acondigital.com/products/acoustica-audio-editor/)

Acoustica is a cross-platform hip-hop DAW that can be used on Mac as well as Windows systems. However, cross-platform compatibility is not the reason why you should pick Acoustica. The tool offers several features that make it a reliable tool for composing hip-hop tracks. Spectral editing and multi-channel support are such few features that’ll help you compose the entire track in a hassle-free manner.

**Pros**

* Easy User Interface
* Advanced functionalities

**Cons**

* You can only record one track at a time
* Works only with Mac OS X 10.11 and later

Presonus can be considered an underdog in the world of hip-hop DAW, which has now started to pick up the pace and match the performance of high-end audio workstations like FL Studio. In the latest version, Presonus offers a variety of features like Harmonic Editing that’ll make your music production a hassle-free task. The latest version also majorly focuses on enhancing the workflow.

**Pros**

* Easy Workflow
* Perfect for Moderate Audio Mixing

The software also offers a decent amount of plugins that’ll help you add professional-touch to your tracks.

**Pros**

* Perfect for Beginners
