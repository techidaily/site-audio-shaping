## Premier List of Zero-Price Online Acoustic Regulators

What is Audio Normalization, what are its different types, why do we need it and how to do it online? – these are the questions we might ask when first learning about it. Well, then, let’s answer all of them!

Audio Normalization means that the loudest parts of an audio signal are set to a specific value. For example, -18 dBFS (decibels relative to full scale). This is done so that all the parts of the sound mix remain at equal volume levels.

You can use this tool when mixing or editing your music, or during playback on your speakers. In the case of mixing, listen for any clipping (A form of waveform distortion - It sounds like the audio is starting to 'break up,' which is light distortion. The more severe it is, the more distorted the music begins to sound) that could occur in your mix. So, in this case, you need to normalize before it becomes too loud and needs more and more fixing. So, normalizing the audio kind of means balancing the volume of the track.

Mostly, audio normalizers are used for balancing out the volume of music, podcast, or other audio recordings. Whenever you have a variety of audio clips that would sound too loud or soft if listened to together, an audio normalizer helps you create a more cohesive listening experience. So, why, and when, do we need to normalize our tracks?

* To make different music styles sound more cohesive;
* To adjust the volume of podcast to be at a consistent level with one another
* To remove sharp spikes in volume for consistent listening experience for our audiences

So, what are the types of audio normalization? Here you have it:

* **peak normalization** \- helps adjust the recording based on the highest signal level present in the recording;
* **loudness normalization** \- adjusts the recording based on perceived loudness;
* **RMS (Root-Mean-Square)** \- changes the value of all the samples, where their average electrical volume overall is a specified level.

So, say that if you are a creator and have listeners, with this tool, you can count on the expectation that people will more likely want to convert to being loyal subscribers, viewers and listeners. This is what happens when audiences feel their user experience is favored and they enjoy a good content – it makes them come back for more.

But sometimes you don’t have so much time that would allow you to find a software, download its installer, install it, learn how to navigate inside its interface, which might be totally new and in some cases, complicated for you, and learn how to normalize your audio files there. In this case, you might want to find the right tools which would enable you to reach your goal without even having to install anything – simple and fast!

Hence, for this case, we would like to offer you the list of 10 best free online audio normalizers. The list goes:

1. MP3 Gain Volume Changer
2. Sodaphonic
3. Audio Mass
4. Audio Online Convert
5. Audio Editor
6. fConvert Online Converter
7. Boost MP3 Volume
8. MP3Cut Change Volume
9. Audio Alter Volume Changer
10. Audio Trimmer Volume Booster

Therefore, let’s delve into each one of them, and learn how to use those online editors in our favor!

## MP3 Gain Volume Changer

This online editor allows you to adjust the volume level of MP3 audio files fast – it can raise, lower, and normalize the volume level of your MP3 files.

The interface is simple and easy to use – exactly what you must be looking for. You can adjust the volume level to make the MP3 the way you want to listen to it.

One of the important things this app is letting you do is to upload from Google Drive or Desktop – it works locally without going through a server, and this means that MP3s do not need to be uploaded to any server.

So, go to this [link](https://mp3gain.flowsoft7.com/). Click on Choose Files and find the audio clip you would like to normalize.

![click on choose files](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-1.jpg)

Now, once your audio track is added, head a little below and find the options you have.

![added audio track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-2.jpg)

Here, you can decide what do really do with your file: do you want to increase or decrease the volume? If you choose automatic normalization, the app will figure something out itself! And, look at the right side – in case you know well your decibels, you can choose how many decibels to apply. But the web-site itself says that 3.0 decibels is recommended, so it would be nice to just stick with it.

If you have multiple files and you want to normalize them all at once, click on Create MP3 (All); in case you have a lot of files and you would like to normalize one or more of them but not all, then your best choice would be Create MP3 (Selected). Another option is that you save your file on Google Drive.

When you Create your file(s), the normalized one(s) will appear under those buttons in Progress Log, and you can Play right away, or Download and listen to it later on.

![appear normalized file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-3.jpg)

## Sodaphonic

Sodaphonic also lets you edit your audio files online. With the help of this editor, you can cut, copy, and paste sound segments of an audio. It offers you: normalizing audio, using audio effects, time-stretching, reversing audio, fade-in and fade-out – those tools are really helpful.

[Sodaphonic](https://sodaphonic.com/editor) is pretty interesting as the first thing that meets the eye is that it lets you not only pick or drop an audio file there, but record something new, too!

![sodaphonic](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-4.jpg)

Any option you choose, then when proceeding into the editor, you will see your file waveform there. In order to normalize the audio, on the top left, find Edit, put a cursor on it, and you will see the menu appear. Find Normalize and click on it.

![find and click on normalize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-5.jpg)

A little window will appear, where you need to fill in how many decibels should be set as the max peak.

![appear window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-6.jpg)

Once you do this and click on Normalize, your file will now be affected, and you can also compare the waveform – it is now a little different, isn’t it?

![file affected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-7.jpg)

So, when you are happy with the result, just go to File, and Choose Export.

## Audio Mass

The Audio Mass editor will help you edit audio and waveforms over the web. There, you can load any audio format your browser supports, and apply many different audio effects (fading in, cutting, trimming…)

So, Audio Mass lets you: normalize audio, analyze frequency, signal distortion and peaking, trim, past, cut audio segments, reversing and inverting audio, convert to MP3, change of volume levels, fade in and fade out, audio compressor, adding reverb, delay, distortion.

When you go to the [web-site](https://audiomass.co/), you can choose your desired file right away and the site will open it in a waveform. Now, the Normalize option is in the Effects (in the menu on the top). Click on it.

![click on normalize option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-8.jpg)

The window opened will show the option to Normalize Left and Right Equally, and it also doesn’t give you decibels – instead, you can choose the percentage on how you would like it to be normalized.

![choose percentage to normalize](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/online-normalizer-9.jpg)

Then, surely, click on the Normalize Audio button and enjoy the result – the waveform itself will show you how different the file becomes…
