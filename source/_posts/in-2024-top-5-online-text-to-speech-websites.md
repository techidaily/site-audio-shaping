If it is compatible with the LAME library, which is an MP3 encoder, it will enable you to export Audacity files as MP3\. The conversion method generally consists of downloading the LAME library & converting the Audacity file to MP3 2 characteristics using the LAME library.

**Note:**

â€¢ Audacity does not have the ability to immediately encode or save Audacity files; you must first download and install the LAME library.

### 1.Download LAME Library

* When the downloading process is complete, just unzip the files as you would normally.

![download-lame-library-poster3](https://images.wondershare.com/download-lame-library-poster3.png)

If you don't know how to start a conversation or how to respond to some of the messages others send you, this platform allows you to use templates to break the ice and convey your messages more effectively. Gender filtration has become very important due to the huge number of active users, to cater to this problem, Shagle provides you with the ability to filter the people you will be connected to by their gender to avoid wasting your time.

**Features**

* Filter users by Country
* Easy to use and connect
