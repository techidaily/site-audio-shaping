## Part 1 What is YouTube Sound library?

Content creators are always treading the tightrope when it comes to budget. They are always watching out for a way to make their work cost-efficient by cutting costs wherever possible.

Sounds and music are some fields where you cannot afford to be cost-effective, as it is bound to hamper the quality of your final product. But buying the rights of music or sound can also have adverse effects on your purse. This is where YouTube Sound Library can save the day for you.

YouTube Sound Library is a segment of YouTube Studio dedicated to presenting content creators like you with royalty-free music from different genres, moods, and artists around the globe.

## Part 2 How to Find YouTube Sound Library?

It’s really easy to find YouTube sound effects library. It doesn’t matter if you are using a computer or a smartphone, it’s the same process that you need to follow. Here is how you can do it –

You’ll find the “Audio Library” option below. Select the “Audio Library” option and you’ll get to the YouTube Sound Library.

## Part 3 Is YouTube Sound Library Free?

A simple answer to this question is: Yes, YouTube Sound Library is free. The sound or the music you procure from this medium is royalty-free. And using it won’t incur the risk of a copyright strike against your content.

But just like every Google and YouTube tool available on the internet, YouTube Sound Library also comes with a bunch of terms and conditions. As a content creator and user of the audio from the library, you will be required to keep those terms and conditions in mind before using the music. If you somehow breach the guidelines mapped out by YouTube, you run the risk of a copyright strike against your content.
