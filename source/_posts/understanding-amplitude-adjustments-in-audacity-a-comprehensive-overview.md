## Understanding Amplitude Adjustments in Audacity: A Comprehensive Overview

Audacity is a free, open access, cross-platform sound editing and recording tool. It is compatible with Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and various other operating systems. All of these aspects have contributed to Audacity's worldwide popularity. Audacity features an amplified effect that alters the loudness of your chosen audio and other practical tools that can change the sound in different ways.

As a result, Audacity can not only assist you in modifying the level of an audio file, but it can also help you equalize, reduce, normalize, and so on.

Yes, you have heard it right, **Audacity increase volume**, but the primary question is how? But don't worry, you will get the answer after reading the article. This article will explain how you can increase or decrease the volume of a whole and a specific segment of the audio file. Let's get started.

## Part 1: How to Increase or Decrease Volume Without Distortion and Clipping in Audacity

Audio clipping occurs when the audio input becomes too loud for an amplifier to produce, and the surplus signal creates distortion. When editing, you cannot add additional volume to your audio clip forever because this would result in clipping. In this case, you can use the Audacity application to emphasize your material by turning the volume up or down without distortion and clipping on a track or recording.

Learn how **Audacity increase volume without distortion** by following the procedure described below:

**Step 1:** First, download and install the Audacity software on your computer.

**Step 2:** Select the **File** from the menu above and click **Open** to open the audio file.

![open audacity audio file](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-audacity-audio-file.jpg)

**Step 3:** Choose the audio track, go to the **Effect** menu and pick the **Amplify** option from the drop-down menu.

![audacity effects amplify adjust audio volume](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effects-amplify-adjust-audio-volume.jpg)

**Note:** You can increase or decrease the volume by double-clicking the track and using the slider under the **Gain** title.

**Step 4:** Increase or decrease the volume by sliding the slider or typing the amplification value in the text box next to it in the Amplify window as needed.

![increase decrease audio volume audacity amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-decrease-audio-volume-audacity-amplify.jpg)

**Note:** Ensure that the **Allow Clipping** checkbox remains unchecked to avoid clipping. Moreover, keep in mind that increasing the volume to a greater extent can result in distortion.

## Part 2: How to Increase Volume of Multiple Files in Audacity?

Audacity is an open-source audio editing tool. It is used for various purposes, like audio recording, music creation, and audio file editing. It also allows you to increase and decrease the volume of audio files.

You may also apply the modifications to multiple files at once, rather than one at a time. Check out the instructions below to learn how to change the volume of multiple audio files:

**Step 1:** Select the **Import** option from the **File** menu, and then pick the **Audio** option. Browse to your audio files, choose all of them, and then click the Open option.

![import audio files to audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-audio-files-to-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** To select all the files, press **Ctrl + A**, click on the **Effect** option in the menu bar and pick **Amplify.**

![select multiple audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-multiple-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, either enter the value in the text box next to the **Amplification Decibels** tab or use the slider under it. To verify the operation of increasing the volume, check the **allow clipping** checkbox. When you're through with the options, click the **Ok** button.

![adjust multiple audio files amplify](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-multiple-audio-files-amplify.jpg)

**Step 4:** Amplification will be applied to all the tracks. Go to the File option from the above menu to export the files and then select the **Export** option.

![export amplified audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-amplified-audio-audacity.jpg)

If youâ€™re running Audacity on macOS computer, you can watch the video tutorial below to apply effects to multiple files.

## Part 3: How to Increase Volume in Certain Parts of Track?

The audacity software also allows you to alter a specific section of an audio file. The selection tool can assist in locating a particular area of the track. After you've chosen a section of the audio file, you may utilize the amplification effect to increase its loudness. Check out the instructions below to learn how you can achieve it:

**Step 1:** Launch the Audacity software on the computer. To open the audio file, go to the **File** menu and select **Open**. You may also open the file by dragging it.

**Step 2:** Ensure that the **Selection tool** is active now. Click and hold the mouse left-click to move from one spot on the track to another.

![select part of audio file audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-part-of-audio-file-audacity.jpg)

**Step 3:** After picking the part, go to the **Effect** option from the menu and select **Amplify**.

![amplify part of audio files audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-part-of-audio-files-audacity.jpg)

**Step 4:** Now, for that specific region, modify the amplification and click **OK**. This will only change the volume for the area you have selected.

![adjust part of audio amplification audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-part-of-audio-amplification-audacity.jpg)

## Part 4: What's the Difference between Normalize and Amplify?

Amplify and Normalize are two essential features of the Audacity tool. Many people think they are the same thing, they are right up to some extent, but there exists a big difference between both the features. Before discussing the differences, you need to know what the terms Normalize and Amplify imply.

### **Amplify**

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

![audacity normalize interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-normalize-interface.jpg)

**Related**: [Best Audio Normalizers for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

It is the quickest approach to comprehend the effect's name if you want to know precisely what impacts are. The frequency of the vibration is enhanced to increase the amplification effect. As previously said, it raises a tiny sound.

Furthermore, because this amplification is extended to all frequencies and amplitude, the noise increases. If you choose ten sources and magnify them by ten decibels, each source will be ten decibels louder than your present sound.

![amplify audio audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/amplify-audio-audacity.jpg)

### **Normalize**

The meaning of [normalizing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is standardized, which is also a feature of its name. Whenever you pick an audio input and use the normalize feature, the level is adjusted automatically according to the previously indicated average volume size in Oda City.

As a result, when one sound source is normalized, there is no discernible difference between it and the amplification mechanism. Still, the effect is evident when several sound sources are performed concurrently.

By pressing Ctrl + A and selecting all ten various audio sources, you may compute the required standard of every sound source, enhance the audio input that is smaller than the normal, and create the audio signal more significant than the standard. Shrink the size of each noise source, such as the name, and normalize the sound.

**Related**: [Best Audio Normalizers for Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### **Differences**

To differentiate the meaning and impact precisely, amplification means increasing or reducing the sound, whereas normalizing means equalizing the sound. Simply defined, if you magnify ten sources by ten decibels, each of the shorter and louder noises equals ten decibels in their actual loudness.

When the ten sources are normalized, the louder sounds grow louder, conforming to the standard sound source size. Because the amplifying is done regardless, the little noises are going insane during this procedure.

## **Conclusion**

All in all, Audacity does an excellent job at audio editing. If you simply need to modify an audio file, Audacity is a great option. For increasing and decreasing the volume of single and multiple audio files, Audacity is still one of the best bets in the market. We hope that now know how **Audacity increase volume** of the audio files after reading this article.

## Enhance Your PC Audio: No-Cost Methods to Amplify Sound on Windows Systems

# 3 Easy Ways to Booster/Increase Volume on Windows for Free

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024â€¢ Proven solutions

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

![bass boost settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

![hd color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg)

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

![apply equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg)

3\. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change **booster sound**. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it's probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.

![change booster-sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg)

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

![insert limiter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg)

5\. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.

![vst container](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg)

6\. Hit upon the file option.

![hit file option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg)

7\. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.

![load vst equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

![open panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg)

9\. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the "**OK**" or "**Apply**" buttons. If "**Apply automatically**" is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.

![apply automatically](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/14-apply-automatically.jpg)

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.

With a simple slider, the usability and convenience of this extension are impressive. Through this, you can enhance, reduce, or increase the volume of a specific tab without affecting the default web browser or system volume settings.

There are three steps to increase volume by using the chrome booster volume plugin.

1\. First, open **Google Chrome**, then move to **Chrome Web Store**. By searching the **Volume Master** here, you will be directed to the link which will open the extension page. Here hit the **Add to Chrome button**.

![add volume master](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/15-add-volume-master.jpg)

2\. A dialogue box will appear. When requested, click the **Add Extension** button to confirm.

![add extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/16-add-extension.jpg)

3\. Click on the extension icon in the right top corner after adding the extension. Now set the volume how much you want it to be boosted as shown in the mentioned slider.

![volume booster plugin](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/17-volume-booster-plugin.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

## Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin

Another effective way to increase volume without any hassle is by using the Chrome extension. For this purpose, the Volume Master extension serves to boost volume without affecting audio quality. This extension can increase volume up to 600%. By using this, you can booster the volume of individual tabs. Plus, Volume Master is super easy to use.

With a simple slider, the usability and convenience of this extension are impressive. Through this, you can enhance, reduce, or increase the volume of a specific tab without affecting the default web browser or system volume settings.

There are three steps to increase volume by using the chrome booster volume plugin.

Most computers have attached speakers, which present adequate sound levels for listening to your favorite music on your screen. However, there are instances when it seems that the volume levels aren't enough. I know how it feels when you play your favorite playlists and can't listen to them at the pitch you want. There are many possibilities to **increase volume** on your windows without speakers.

There are many methods for raising the default sound levels on Windows. You can control and **booster volume** and the audio quality on your device sometimes through some of the built-in settings and most of the time with a third-party app that may increase it by 500%.

Here in this article is a discussion about how to help **boost volume** as desired on your computer.

* [Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster](#part1)
* [Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application](#part2)
* [Method 3: Increase volume by Chrome Volume Booster Plugin](#part3)
* [Bonus Tip: Edit your audio with Wondershare Filmora](#part4)

## Method 1: Boost volume by Native Windows Volume Booster

Most users ignore sound and video settings within Windows without ensuring that the volume is set to a satisfactory level and the display quality is accurate. Windows has an equalizer, which you can use to improve the audio quality. The Windows 10 equalizer focuses on the critical techniques for modifying audio properties like balance and volume and can help you boost volume.

1\. Click the **Control Panel** by typing **Control** at the Windows Run prompt to have the equalizer settings. Click **Hardware and Sound** under the Sound when the Control Panel appears. This will bring up a dialogue box with a list of all of your computer's audio hardware.

![hardware and sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-hardware-and-sound.jpg)

2\. The default setting for spatial Sound is to switch it off. You can, therefore, have some options for allowing spatial Sound based on your audio hardware and the software you've enabled. For example, in the picture below, there is a feature called Windows Sonic for Headphones.

![select spatial sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-select-spatial-sound.jpg)

3\. Pick the Bass Boost (or any of your profiles) and hit the **Settings** key to make adjustments. This enables Windows to display a dialogue box to adjust the raised level for each Frequency individually.

![bass boost settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-bass-boost-settings.jpg)

4\. To get to the Windows **Video Playback** settings, click the **Settings**, then **Apps**, then **Video Playback**, choose automatic processing to enhance video playback.

![video playback settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-video-playback-settings.jpg)

5\. Some more settings will be accessed via this screen that helps to change the HD color settings if your PC allows it. A preview window enables you to see how your choices would affect the final result.

![hd color settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-hd-color-settings.jpg)

## Method 2: Boost sound by Equalizer APO Application

Equalizer APO Application is an excellent graphic equalizer for Windows that can be used to boost volume. With VST plugin support and unlimited filters, this application is easy to use.

1\. From the start, the menu clicks in the Equalizer APO or configuration Editor.

![equalizer application menu](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-equalizer-application-menu.jpg)

2\. Apply the Equalizer at the given arrow part.

![apply equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-apply-equalizer.jpg)

3\. The arrow mentioned in the below picture can change **booster sound**. The sound wave will shift, and the maximum will come out; just split it with an equalizer, so it's probably best to lower the boost to avoid cutting.

![change booster-sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-change-booster-sound.jpg)

4\. Better insert the limiter at the end of the Equalizer; this may avoid clipping. Hit the plus icon, then click plugins/VST plugin.

![insert limiter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/9-insert-limiter.jpg)

5\. The VST container will be inserted at the end of the process.

![vst container](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/10-vst-container.jpg)

6\. Hit upon the file option.

![hit file option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/11-hit-file-option.jpg)

7\. Click the VST file when the VST preview window opens (extension .dll). VST 2 is the only format that is supported. Because there is no connection feature, you must use VST with the same number of items as Equalizer APO. Now VST can be loaded.

![load vst equalizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/12-load-vst-equalizer.jpg)

8\. Now click on the "**Open Panel**" tab.

![open panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/13-open-panel.jpg)

9\. The user interface is visible now. Kindly remember that, unlike DAW, the setting may not be applied until you hit the "**OK**" or "**Apply**" buttons. If "**Apply automatically**" is selected, the settings will be displayed instantly, just as in DAW.
