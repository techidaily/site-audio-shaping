## Securing Your Google Voice Chats: Phone & Desktop Recording Techniques Explained

Many people think that the call-recording feature is only helpful to deal with stalkers and obsessive exes. However, there are several other reasons as well.

Call recording features help you in numerous ways such as conducting remote interviews, keeping track of verbal agreements, and recording important meetings for later reference. A myriad of applications are available on iPhone and android.

Since most voice recording applications are expensive, Google voice turns out to be one of the best apps to record calls.

## What Is Google Voice?

The Google voice recording app is available on Android and iOS app stores and enables users to record calls, send text messages, customize voicemails, and save call recording transcripts. Previously, this app required a Google Voice invite code for registration. But, now as a Gmail user, you can download and record your calls with Google Voice for free.

## How to Use Google Voice

When you will register with Google voice recorder, you will receive a mobile number that connects your work phone, desk phone, mobile phone, and even VoIP lines.
