Expressing ideas through music was never easy, and even today in the age of powerful digital audio stations like [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/) or [FruityLoops](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/), producing original music requires a certain set of skills. However, online content producers often need music for their videos, but they neither have the time or the budget to hire a professional musician to create a soundtrack for their project in studio conditions. If you are looking for a quick way to make your own music online, then you should keep reading, because in this article we are going to take you through the ten best online music makers you should check out in 2021.

Rather than being an online music maker, Autochords is more a tool that helps piano and guitar players understand chord progressions better. iPhone and iPad users can download the Autochords app from the App Store for free.
