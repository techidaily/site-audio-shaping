<p>The Clubhouse’s popularity is increasing day by day, and you might have heard about it by now. Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p>
<p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application. If you are a regular fork who wants to know what’s going down on this exclusive social media platform and what it actually is, then we are here to guide you. Here is what you need to know about Clubhouse.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-Clubhouse"><a href="#What-is-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="What is Clubhouse?"></a><strong>What is <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/clubhouse-drop-in-audio-chat/id1503133294" >Clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>?</strong></h2><p>In simple words, Clubhouse is a voice-based social media app where people can interact with each other and do discussions on various topics in chatrooms. It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>
<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>
<p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work"><a href="#How-does-it-work" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2><p>![ clubhouse-interface1](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> interface2.png)</p>
<p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p>
<p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>
<p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time. This app has a simple interface, and it is easy to use. Once you create an account on this app, then you cannot delete your account, and you have to email the support team to request account deletion.</p>
<h2 id="Who-Uses-Clubhouse"><a href="#Who-Uses-Clubhouse" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Clubhouse?"></a><strong>Who Uses Clubhouse?</strong></h2><p>The Clubhouse is getting popular among a lot of big celebrities. If you explore the app, then you may find people like Oprah, Kevin Hart, Drake, Chris Rock, or Ashton Kutcher talking in different rooms. They might be hosting different chats. This is basically the most appealing thing about the Clubhouse. You may get a chance to engage and chat with a lot of famous and popular people. It is one of the best apps out there for networking purposes.

You can interact with them and ask for answers and solutions to your questions and problems. Most people and celebrities use Clubhouse fearlessly because they know that whatever they say on this application is not going to be a news headline the very next day.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse’s popularity is increasing day by day, and you might have heard about it by now. Many celebrities and influencers are already on it, and you might have heard them talking about their clubhouse conversations in their Instagram stories. In short, you may have heard a lot about this app, and you might be wondering why it is getting so popular. This is because this social media application has developed its reputation in part on exclusivity.</p>
<p>Although celebrities are joining this app, China has blocked it, and investors think this app has billion-dollar potential. The app is now viral these days, and according to some analytics, it got almost 2 Million installs in the first week of February. The app has taken over social media by storm. It is developed by <strong>Paul Davison</strong>, who was an entrepreneur at silicon valley, and <strong>Rohan Seth</strong>, who is an ex-Google employee. The main theme of this application revolves around the audio-chat.</p>
<p>Although it was released in 2020, it recently got a lot of attention when Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk made his entry on this application. His conversation with the chief of Robinhood Markets, Vladimir Tenev, went viral on this platform, and we saw a sudden spike in the downloads of this application. If you are a regular fork who wants to know what’s going down on this exclusive social media platform and what it actually is, then we are here to guide you. Here is what you need to know about Clubhouse.</p>

It is a new type of social product that allows its users to talk to anyone, tell stories, discuss ideas, and make friends worldwide. You can think of it just like a zoom phone call where all cameras are turned off, and sometimes it becomes difficult to keep track of who is talking.</p>
<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>
<p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p>

<p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p>
<p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>
<p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time. This app has a simple interface, and it is easy to use.

<p>There are a variety of rooms in this app it means that you can jump into the chat rooms of different formats. To avoid chaos and disturbance in chat rooms, most rooms are held in a way that only a few people are speaking, and the rest of the audience is listening. It is something similar to a live and free-flowing podcast. You can choose to share your thoughts, or you can listen quietly to others.</p>
<p>Different clubhouse niches like song-writers, Entrepreneurs, Counselors, etc., could be an enjoyable way to spend your time. Listening to other people and talking about your problems freely makes you feel really good. It can open many networking opportunities for you, and with a private room option, you can organize an audio-party with your pals. One thing that must be kept in mind is that the conversation does not go outside the application as there is no recording option available, and discussions are not saved.</p>
<h2 id="How-does-it-work-3"><a href="#How-does-it-work-3" class="headerlink" title="How does it work?"></a><strong>How does it work?</strong></h2><p>![ clubhouse-interface1](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse" >https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clubhouse <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> interface2.png)</p>
<p>The Clubhouse is only available on iOS devices right now. You cannot access it via Android or the web. It is also an invite-only app right now. It means that you need to know an existing clubhouse user if you want to join it. The current clubhouse users need to give access to their entire contact list to the application if they want to invite some of their friends.</p>
<p>If you are already a Twitter or Facebook user, then you should know that clubhouse rooms aren’t entirely free for all. There are some moderators who can freely speak, and they can also allow participants from the audience to speak freely. There is a subtle grey halo around the picture of participants that indicates who is speaking.</p>
<p>Anyone can create a room and set it to open. If a room is open, then it means that anyone can pop in. You can also create a social room which means that only your followers can join the room. In the end, there is a closed room option which for the invited guests only. The app also has clubs that can have members and can create re-occurring rooms.</p>
<p>You can follow clubs and people to know when they are participating in rooms and moderating. If you click on the calendar icon, you will get an unfiltered list of rooms happening at that time. This app has a simple interface, and it is easy to use. Once you create an account on this app, then you cannot delete your account, and you have to email the support team to request account deletion.</p>
<h2 id="Who-Uses-Clubhouse-3"><a href="#Who-Uses-Clubhouse-3" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Clubhouse?"></a><strong>Who Uses Clubhouse?</strong></h2><p>The Clubhouse is getting popular among a lot of big celebrities.

This is basically the most appealing thing about the Clubhouse. You may get a chance to engage and chat with a lot of famous and popular people. It is one of the best apps out there for networking purposes. Elon Musk, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerburg also made their appearances on this app, after which people saw a tremendous increase in its downloads.</p>
<p>Other than celebrities, the exclusivity of Clubhouse makes you feel secure and comfortable. There is a lot to learn, and you can do something productive on your time.

<p>If the details mentioned above raised your interest in this application, then you should know that it is not for everyone. If you want to join this app, you have to be invited by someone already a user. If you get an invite from a registered user, you can then extend the invite to four other friends. If you do not get an invite and download the app directly from the Apple app store, they will put you on a waiting list. The Clubhouse CEO has promised that the app is going to open for everyone, eventually even for android users. But, right now, they want to grow their number of users slowly to make arrangements for the bigger number of users and overcome the difficulties that the existing users are facing.</p>
<p>If you want to download this application, then simply go to the apple app store and search for Clubhouse: Drop-in audio chat application. Download and install this application. After that, it will ask you to register. If an already registered user invites you, then you will be able to use this application with its full functionality; otherwise, you can reserve a username, and they will put you on their sweet waiting list.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories"><a href="#Part-1-What-are-podcast-directories" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What are podcast directories?"></a>Part 1. What are podcast directories?</h2><p>A podcast directory is a listening app. It’s the place where podcasts and their listeners meet. Podcast listeners search for, subscribe to, and listen to your Podcast using their podcast directory of choice. Popular podcast directories include Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and Google Podcasts.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024"><a href="#Part-2-15-Top-podcast-directories-to-focus-on-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024"></a>Part 2. 15 Top podcast directories to focus on in 2024</h2><p>Thankfully, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.edisonresearch.com/u-s-top-podcast-networks-by-reach-q2-2022/" >research conducted by EdisonResearch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> shows the weekly audience reach of top podcast directories. So this list will help us locate the best podcasting directories. And it can multiply your audience size and quickly reach a more extensive user base.</p>
<p>According to Edison Research, the top 15 Podcast Networks are:</p>

                      alt="edison podcast metrics"
                ></p>
<p>You must retain that Edison’s research only analyzes the US podcast services. Yet, our guide has compiled the best podcasting directories to connect with users worldwide.</p>
<p>Below you will find the list of top podcast directories and their reviews. But keep in mind that when it comes to podcast directories, there is no such thing as best or worse. Instead, it’s all about the user base and audience reach. So, it is best to submit your podcasts to multiple podcasting directories.</p>
<h3 id="1-YouTube"><a href="#1-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="1. YouTube"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/" >YouTube <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>With a monthly active user base of 2.5 billion, YouTube should be the top choice of any podcast creator. According to a recent survey by Statista, YouTube took over Spotify to become the largest platform for podcast consumption worldwide. Additionally, 47.7% of the US audience prefers YouTube over other platforms for listening to podcasts.</p>
<p>Not to forget, YouTube comes pre-installed on all smartphones and is also accessible via the Web to users worldwide. Another benefit of YouTube is that it is free for creators and users. Plus, once you grow your user base, it also allows you to get surplus revenue.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory youtube"
                ></p>
<p>Of course, YouTube is a video-only platform. Still, you can use tools like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to create video-based podcasts seamlessly. You can simply convert the video podcasts into an audio format using Filmora itself and then reupload the same Podcast to even audio-based podcast directories.</p>

<p>Tools like Fimora also allow you to directly publish the created Podcast on YouTube (so you do not have to worry about video requirements mandatory for YouTube).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of YouTube on G2</strong>: “YouTube is one of those sites that you can’t live without for a business. Everyone knows what YouTube is, and users (globally) use the platform daily.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 2.5 billion active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All major OS and web browsers.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-Spotify"><a href="#2-Spotify" class="headerlink" title="2. Spotify"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.spotify.com/" >Spotify <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Spotify has over 389 million listeners across 187 markets worldwide. Available on all major OS and its web presence makes it one of the best directories of podcasts on the internet.</p>
<p>Aside from its audience base, Spotify also provides real-time insights, like who your audience is, what they like, which episodes they prefer, and even what songs they want. All these insights will also help you plan your future content according to the audience.</p>

                      alt="podcast directory spotify"
                ></p>
<p>Spotify’s personalized recommendations and algorithms are another pluses, given you can get discovered easily&#x2F; Like YouTube, Spotify allows you to upload even video podcasts. While you can also create and upload podcasts in audio format only.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Spotify on G2</strong>: “I can find any song, artist, album, and even podcasts at any time and no commercials.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 360 million active users.</li>

<h3 id="3-Apple-Podcasts"><a href="#3-Apple-Podcasts" class="headerlink" title="3. Apple Podcasts"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasters.apple.com/" >Apple Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Apple Podcast is another top directory for a podcast that creators cannot ignore. Given it is an exclusive-podcast platform, its 28.5 million active user base in more than 170 countries and regions is enough to tell its greatness.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand that YouTube and Spotify are not exclusive podcast platforms like Apple Podcasts. And while Spotify and YouTube are best for connecting novice podcast listeners, Apple Podcast is the way to go if you want to connect with a dedicated podcast community.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="podcast directory apple podcast"
                ></p>
<p>The best thing about the Apple Podcast directory is it allows you to create a podcast (via Apple Podcast Connect), but you must be an Apple user. However, you can submit your podcasts to Apple Podcast via RSS feed even if you are not an Apple user.</p>
<p>In all, given Apple Podcast is available for Apple users and is known by default on all Apple devices (the most prominent smartphone company in the world), Apple Podcast is a must-use podcast directory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Apple Podcast</strong>: “Apple once again nails with simplicity, millions of shows of my interest, and freemium service.”</li>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 28.5 million active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: All Apple devices.</li>
</ul>

Google Podcasts"></a>4. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://podcasts.google.com/" >Google Podcasts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Google Podcasts has over 100 million downloads on Play Store alone and is also available on the web, App Store, Blackberry, and ChromeOS users. A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="podcast directory google podcasts"
                ></p>
<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Google Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Google Podcast includes everything that a podcast listener wants. It’s simple, free, and includes valuable options like Sleep Timer, Playback speed, and more.”</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monthly User Base</strong>: Over 30 million active users.</li>
<li><strong>Supported OS</strong>: Dedicated apps for all major OS and web presence.</li>

Pandora"></a>5. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.pandora.com/" >Pandora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Pandora has over 64 million monthly active users, with a listener spending up to 24 hours&#x2F;monthly on the platform. It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Review of Pandora Podcast</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>“Pandora Podcasts recommendations are a blessing for me, who always finds it confusing to locate the right episode to spend my time on.”</p>

Its monthly active user base is around 41 million. The biggest benefit of registering your Podcast on the Audible directory of podcasts is that it connects with users who use Alexa to discover new podcasts.</p>
<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<p>It is important to note that both Amazon Music and Audible offer podcasts for entirely free to users, so a more extensive user base prefers these platforms over paid platforms.</p>

<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been using the app for 4 years. I like it, but there are some annoying “features.”</p>
<ol>
<li><p>the screen won’t time out when the app is active.</p>
</li>
<li><p>the developers must have recently made a change. I used to search through my list of “recent” (there were about 20) to look for new episodes of my favorite podcasts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, the app only allows me to see the last four podcasts or stations I have listened to. So it is not helpful.’</p>

<p>**”**Been using this for years. It does everything I could ever want when listening&#x2F; referencing&#x2F; re-listening to my favorite podcasts and a lot more.</p>
<p>I’ve suffered through having to use other podcast players (e.g., listening to something “exclusive”), but I couldn’t stand the inane simplicity of other players long enough to finish their content.</p>
<p>Also, it takes a bit to get used to (especially if you’re coming from other stripped-down players), but very worth the small effort for a powerful app.”</p>

<p>“Glad I waited a while to find a podcast website provider. Starting from scratch in WordPress seemed too much hassle. Luckily the site came along while I was dithering about what to do.</p>
<p>The RadioPublic team onboarded the other 5 billion podcasts as one of the first examples, and I’m delighted to have chosen this option.

A completely subscription-free and ad-free platform, Google Podcasts is one of the top podcasting directories among users.</p>
<p>However, unlike the Apple Podcast directory, it does not have a studio, so you can only submit your podcasts via RSS feeds. Still, its user base and the advanced algorithms are an opportunity to connect with users who like the subjects you discuss.</p>

<p>Like Spotify and Apple Podcast directories, Google Podcasts also show you real-time analytics and guide you about users so that you can plan your content accordingly. Given that it only requires a Google account to start, it is another top podcast directory you cannot ignore.</p>

It explains that users spend up to 45 minutes on the Pandora platform tuning in to their favorite podcasts. Again, its search-based algorithms allow you to get discovered by users that like subjects and topics on which you’re creating podcasts, meaning it is simple to connect with a large user base conveniently.</p>

<p>Pandora only accepts podcasts via RSS feed, which should be in MP3 format. But recent notifications have shown more audio formats will be added.</p>
<p>However, it is vital to retain that Pandora Podcast’s team critically analyzes all submissions manually. So, it might take up to 4-6 weeks for your first Podcast to appear on the platform.</p>

<p>Besides Audible, the Podcast will also be available for users of the Amazon Music app. That means you can connect with even more users via one submission only. Not to forget, Amazon Prime Video (a massive following) users get a free subscription to Amazon Music, so there’s a perfect chance that you will connect with users conveniently.</p>

<p>“I’ve been using this app for years now. It’s been my trusty companion to give me the news. I primarily use it with the sleep timer. I’m not a super picky consumer, especially when I don’t pay for the app!</p>
<p>But for many months now, the sleep timer will frequently think the time is up and shut off the player well before it should. The player will often shut off within 5 minutes of using the 30 min sleep timer. It’s annoying to open the player hit resume, and reset the sleep timer.”</p>
