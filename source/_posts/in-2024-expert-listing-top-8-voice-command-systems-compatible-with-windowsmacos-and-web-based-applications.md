## Part 2 Online Video Editor with Music

If you want to learn how to edit music into a video, but you do not have a powerful computer, it can be an issue. This is because most entry-level computers and older computers won’t be able to run a heavy tempo music video with effects that require a powerful computer. Fortunately, you can still edit videos on your computer to add music to them. Thanks to the wide range of online video editors out there, you can do this. As a result, you can make a video with pictures and music online using any web browser.

Since almost everyone wants to edit videos and music in them, you can find all kinds of online video editors. While some are paid, almost all others are entirely free to use. And if you are editing videos online using a web browser, likely, you are not familiar with video editors. As a result, it is also quite important to ensure that any given online video editor is also easy to use. After keeping all of these factors in mind, the [Add Audio in Video tool by Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/add-audio-to-video) is a great option.

● Now, change the Options toggle to Replace Audio in Video or as you prefer. You can also change the Volume and Position options as desired.

● Finally, click on the Add button to insert music into your video file. Once the video is edited and music has been added, you can then download it on your computer right away.

## Part 3 Free Music Video Editor App

Even though online video editors do not require a powerful computer, you will still need a computer for using them. And since not everyone has a computer, this can be a huge issue for many users. However, if you upload video files on social media websites, you certainly have a smartphone with you. In that case, you will be glad to know that you can even edit videos on your mobile device. This is made possible thanks to the various free music video editor app options.

While there are many video editors for mobile devices, the [Mast Music Video Status Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mast.status.video.edit&hl=en%5FIN&gl=US) is a great option for most. It offers a wide range of templates, video effects, music tracks, stickers, color filters, etc. And since it also has an easy-to-use interface, it is one of the best music video animation maker apps for mobile devices. Even though it is quite straightforward to insert video and audio files in this app for combining them, you can go through the following instructions if you are confused:

● Inside the Mast Music Video Status Maker app, you can find the Add button to import all of your video files.

● Once that is done, go to the Music icon tab, where you can find a wide range of popular music tracks.
