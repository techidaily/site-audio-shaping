[Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) For macOS 10.14 or later

The Filmora software collection may run on machines running either Windows or macOS operating systems. It is possible to get free product samples to test them out before buying them. On the official Filmora website, you can see pricing choices for each program.

The Filmora Video Editor is easy to use and delivers various features superior to those provided by other video editors. Because of this, it is considered one of the best audio editors to answer **how to** **remove static from audio** and video.

Here is **how to remove static noise from audio** with Filmora.

Step1 Upload Files

Open Wondershare Filmora and load your video into the timeline window. You can get a video preview, cut it up, and remove the bits you don't want to preserve.

Step2 Edit Audio

Select "Edit Audio" by using the context menu after right-clicking the movie in the timeline. You will see four options: silence detection, modify audio, disconnect audio, and mute. Choose the "Audio" option from the drop-down menu if you want to separate the audio from the video.

Step3 Remove Background Static

Double-click on the audio track to eliminate the background noise directly, and pick "normal denoise" from the Edit Panel. You may also double-click the video clip in the timeline to reach the Editing panel without first separating the audio from the video. Once there, you can edit the audio and eliminate the noise by clicking on the Audio tab in the Editing panel.

## Part 3: How to Record Noise-Free Audio?

So, that was **how to remove static sound from audio**. But what if you record noise-free audio instead?

If you record with a microphone and continue to hear static noise, the problem most likely lies in the cable. Most microphone cables consist of one or two conductors (wires) braided together inside a metal. This is the function that protection fulfills. It prevents the hum or static created by signals coming from outside from interfering with the signal flowing via the internal conductors.

If one of the shield connections at either end of the wire is only sometimes present or isn't there, this might produce static electricity. If you can access the connection, check that all cables and shields are connected safely and securely.

Near a stable electromagnetic source is another possible explanation for static, which may be industrial motors or high-power radio transmitters.

Another characteristic of microphones is their impedance. It would be best to use microphone with the same impedance as the recording device.

One last step is to test the static using a different microphone to determine whether the problem persists. If this is the case, the recording device can be the source of the issue.

## Conclusion

Do you believe that a grainy or unsteady video is a problem? Video quality is vital, but audio noise can quickly damage your film. However, **removing static sound from audio** may be a pain in the neck. In addition, capturing clear audio may be challenging, particularly in areas with a lot of background noise.

Now you have an audio file with less or no noise and want to learn **how to remove static noise from audio**. With the above suggestions, I hope you'll find eliminating background noise from the video easy. If you want to be more creative in removing **static noise from audio**, try the Filmora video editor to give your mind a boost.

## The Pathway to Pristine Data: Utilizing AI for Improved Audio Quality

## How to DeNoise AI

There have often been times when we took some photo or video with our mobile phones or digital cameras, but we found out later that the clip contained hiss, some compression or particles. Everyone, especially in this digital world, is trying to make their content as clean as possible, without impurities, for the audiences to watch, enjoy, and stay with the creators. So, you might find it really uncomfortable when you are in this kind of situation. But what you can do, is doable – you can depend on a video denoise software!

There are a lot of online or offline tools you could use to do that, and we have discussed a lot of them on our web-site, and now, we will review yet another way to achieve your desired result when it comes to noise and grain. So, in today’s article, we will touch upon how to AI DeNoise your image!

The case with this intelligent noise reduction for 2022 is that noise reduction software has been the same for over a decade. This is when DeNoise AI comes to play, because its approach is something new – it uses deep learning. The process is lengthy and focuses on learning millions of images, thus let DeNoise AI to accurately distinguish between real image detail and noise. This is so important because with this new technique, now it is possible to denoise images while actually recovering important detail, something that was impossible a few years ago.

Topaz DeNoise AI has a very simple and intuitive interface with different noise removal options. Anyway, using it in the most effective way would require some knowledge. Oh, and, it would be a headache if you have a slow computer!..

So, as mentioned, traditional noise reduction software most of the time reduces the original detail in the images, but DeNoise AI’s noise reduction eliminates noise, meanwhile, preserves the detail and even enhances it. The new update of Topaz DeNoise AI offers different advanced DeNoise AI Models that can be integrated perfectly into your workflow; you can use it as a standalone piece of software or as a plugin for Adobe Photoshop or Lightroom.

## How to AI DeNoise a file

Let’s just suppose you don’t have the software. So, download and install Topaz DeNoise AI. Go to Topaz Labs and select your operating system: Windows or Macintosh OS. Then, install the program.

![download and install topaz denoise ai](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-1.jpg)

Once the installation is finished, you will be able to see the Topaz DeNoise AI icon among your applications. Topaz DeNoise AI plugins for Lightroom or Photoshop would also be added there automatically, without any further intervention. But, if that is not the case, it’s ok to add them manually.

The first time you open Topaz DeNoise AI, you can either log in with your Topaz Labs account or try the Denoise AI 30-day free trial.

So, let’s discover how to use DeNoise AI in its different versions!

**First, how to remove digital noise with DeNoise AI:** DeNoise AI supports most of the commonly used photography files like raw files, dng, tiff, jpegs, etc. So, open the program, drag or open your image and select the best AI model.

In the upper right corner, you will find a toolbar with these options:

**Preview Options:**

To change the view mode of the photo you’re working with, you can select:

* Original (original photo preview)
* Single (denoised photo preview).
* Split (Original and denoised photo preview with a split slider)
* Side by Side ( Original and denoised photo preview)
* Comparison ( Compare how the different Ai Models work in your photos at the same time).

**Zoom**

Zoom in on your images to accurately check the process’s progress.

![zoom in on images](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-2.jpg)

Denoise AI full review and tutorial

On the right side, you’ll find:

* A navigator with the selected zoom box.
* A list with the following DeNoise AI Models:
* Standard: Broadly developed noise reduction that maintains detail.
* Clear: Best for photos with smooth and rounded surfaces such as skin, rocks, water, etc.
* Low light: Best for low-light conditions and heavy noise
* Severe noise: Best for extremely noisy photos
* Raw: The newest AI model in DeNoise. It provides excellent noise reduction, preserving detail, and authentic color starting from a RAW file.
* Main Settings. The Auto mode works great in most situations. However, it can be pretty aggressive and give your photos a washed-out look. With Manual Mode, you can set the adjustments according to your taste.
* The Post-processing sliders help reduce any color noise remaining in your photos and preserve original detail.
* Save Image: To set your output settings before saving your images.

![set output settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-3.jpg)

Then, adjust the setting sliders (you can just select Auto mode here); now, apply the adjustments locally, if necessary, using the mask tool; and, save the file with the output settings selected.

**Second, let’ts move to DeNoise AI workflow.**

If you are trying to find the simplest way to start with DeNoise Ai, it’s better to use the suggested mode, - Light bulb icon! This will automatically select an AI model, and will do so based oon your image. Anyway, in order to remove digital noise there, it’s the best to use the updated comparison view. The reason is obvious – you can take a look right away and compare varied AI models, or the same ones with some different settings to your liking.

![use light bulb icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-4.jpg)

So, how to do just that? Well, select the AI model and fine-tune the adjustment using the following settings:

* Remove Noise: This slider is wonderful!. It removes the noise in your photo, but doesn’t kind of wash out the images. Values between 10-50 are the best in most cases.
* Enhance Sharpness: It sharpens and recovers the detail in images that may become a bit blurry after denoising. It would be excessive if you set the values over 30, in case you would like to avoid odd textures.

After that, you can refine your results with these DeNoise AI Post-processing adjustments:

* Recover Original Detail: It helps recover some detail that has been washed out after the noise reduction and adds a bit of grain to keep the image natural. 20-40 points is more than enough.
* Color Noise Reduction: This is a powerful tool that reduces any color noise remaining in your images. Zoom in on a dark area and adjust the slider until the color noise disappears and you are happy with the result!

**And, the last topic to discuss is DeNoise AI Masking Tool!** The software includes a very simple Mask tool in case you want to denoise the image only in certain areas and not in others. So, the key here is that DeNoise AI will apply your adjustments only to the areas that you paint in red.

You need to ckeck the Overlay tool to see the red color while painting. When you are satisfied with the areas you panted, After painting over these areas, you will see a preview of your mask in black and white. Here, white shows the adjustments while black hides them. Following this, DeNoise AI will just be applied to the areas painted in white.

![check overlay tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/07/ai-denoise-5.jpg)

And, the masking settings are:

* Add/Subtract: to paint in white or black and reveal or hide your adjustments.
* Size: to change the size of your brush.
* Softness: to change the hardness of your brush. Being 0 is the hardest and 100 the softest.
* Opacity: to vary the opacity of the mask to add precise local adjustments.
* Mask options: to clear or invert your mask.
* Overlay: to show in red these areas where you are painting.

Once you finish creating your mask, just click on the “apply mask” button, and there you go!
