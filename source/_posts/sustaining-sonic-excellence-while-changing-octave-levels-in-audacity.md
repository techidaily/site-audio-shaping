## Sustaining Sonic Excellence While Changing Octave Levels in Audacity

You may raise or lower the pitch of a pre-recorded song. Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the **Audacity change pitch** feature. Let’s get started.

02 [How to Change Pitch in Audacity?](#part2)

## Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?

Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.

On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.

## Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.

So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the **Audacity change pitch** technique when editing?

### 7. Fake Voice

With Fake Voice’s easy-to-use interface, you can quickly change how your voice sounds. You can also increase or decrease the pitch and timbre of your sound. However, the problem with Fake Voice is that there’s no in-built male to female voice changer setting. If you want to change a voice, you have to do it yourself, which can be an issue.

![Voice Changer Fake Voice ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/fakewebcam-fake-voice.jpg)

Here’s how you can do it -

* Download [Fake Voice](http://www.fakevoice.com/) on your computer and install it.
* When you open the app, you will need to register with your email ID and select the microphone.
* Once you complete registration, you will see the app’s main window, where you have three options - Voice Changer, Robot (effect) and Echo (effect).
* You can use the voice changer male to female feature by toggling on the Voice Changer option.
* Manipulate the Pitch, Formant, Noise Threshold, and Base Pitch options to change your male voice to female.

### 8. Audacity

Audacity is a free third-party audio editor software that also allows you to record audio from apps like Google Meet. It is compatible with Windows and Mac, but the issue with this app is that you can only change pre-recorded sounds. You also have to adjust the pitch manually, speed and tempo to use the male to female voice changer.

The steps to do that are -

* [Download](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/) and install Audacity from their website.
* Open the app, and from the tabs on top of the window, select Effects.
* You will see three options in the drop-down menu - Change Pitch, Change Speed and Change Tempo.
* You will have to manipulate each of these options to get the desired female voice.

### 9. GarageBand

[GarageBand](https://www.apple.com/in/mac/garageband/) is a software available for Apple and Windows users. If you are a musician, this free app can quickly help you meet your music editing needs. You have the option to use the male to female voice changer, but you can do it only within the app for pre-existing audio.

Here’s how you can do it -

* Download and install the app on your computer.
* Select the track whose sound you want to change.
* From the Track Info tab, click on the Edit panel. There you’ll find the Default selector.
* In this selector, click on the Male to Female option.

### Final Thoughts

As you can see, these are the top ten free and paid software that you can use for your male to female voice changer needs. You can even use some of them to create customized voices. Be it pranking someone, hiding your identity on social media or making animated voices for your films - there is some excellent software out there to come to your help.
