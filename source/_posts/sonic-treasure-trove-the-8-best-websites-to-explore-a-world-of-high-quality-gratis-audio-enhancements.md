**Summary**

The **rain sounds download** process is pretty simple as long as you have access to the libraries that are populated with HD-quality acoustics. Many web portals also offer various music types from different niches that can be used not only for your personal relaxations, but also in your commercial projects. All you need to do in order to get such sounds is, check whether they are royalty-free or have some license that need some credits or payments to be made to the original creators. m.
