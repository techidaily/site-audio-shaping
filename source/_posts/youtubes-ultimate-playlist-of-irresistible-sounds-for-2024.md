### Step 3: Interview Mode

The next mode is the "Interview" mode. This mode makes use of two microphones, which are connected at each end of the phone. The mode works like a charm when you are expected to record a conversational interview. To use the "Interview" mode, follow the steps given below:

* Choose "Interview" and then click on the "Record" button.
* Click on "Stop" after you are done with the audio recording. After that, click on "Save" to save the final output.

### Step 4: Speech-to-Text Mode

"Speech to Text" is the last mode presented by the default voice recorder in Samsung S10/S9\. It converts your words into text efficiently. The user is only expected to choose the final output language that you want to transcribe into. Follow the step-by-step guide below to use this mode.

* Pick "Speed to Text" mode. Hit the "Record" button once you have gathered your thoughts.
* Now, start speaking, and the audio will be converted into text. Click on "Stop" and then save the recording.
