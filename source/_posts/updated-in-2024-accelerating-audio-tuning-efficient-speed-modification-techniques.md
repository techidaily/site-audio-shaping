![add music to audio track](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-music-to-filmora-timeline.jpg)

Open Filmora video editor on your Windows or Mac computer, and import your audio file to the audio track in the timeline. Go to the **Titles** tab, and select your preferred title. There are plentiful title templates in Filmora video editor for different scenarios, such as gaming, social media, education & tutorial, travel, and sports. If you just want to add plain text, you can go to the Basic category or Plain Text category to add simple text without any animation.

**Step 2: Type text to build the Lyrics you want**

![customize lyric texts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/customize-lyric-titles-filmora.jpg)

 Double click the title in the timeline and then click the **Advanced** button to go to the Advanced Text Edit window. From there, you can write your lyrics, add a text box, change colors and font, and add animations to the lyrics.
