Step 3: Convert and Save

Once the audio is on the media panel, tap the “Export” button on the top right corner, and from the format tab, choose the “MP3” option.

Change the file save location if required or click the “Export” option to get the converted audio file.

Like the online audio converter tools, you can convert WhatsApp audio to MP3 with Filmora hassle-free.

## Conclusion

Thus, instead of just waiting, start converting your WhatsApp audio to MP3 with the tools discussed above, and shred the space occupied by the large files. If you require a video/audio editor tool for long-lasting projects and unique creations, Filmora is the best recommendation that you must try!
