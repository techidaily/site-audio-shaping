## "Unlock the Potential of AMR WAVES: Detailed Guide to Their Conversion and Manipulation "

# AMR Audio Converter: Convert AMR Files Easily

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

AMR is an abbreviation for Adaptive Multi-Rate Audio Codec. It is a technology that utilizes audio compression formats primarily for speech. A typical AMR speech codec will have a multi-rate of eight bitrate values that range from 4.75kb/s to 12.2 kb/s. The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.

In addition to compressing speech, the AMR file format can also be used for the storage of spoken audio using the same codec. There are a number of modern telephones that has the capability to store short audio recordings using the AMR format. There are also other programs, both free and proprietary that can be used to convert files from this format to other various formats and vice versa. However, since AMR file format was initially designed for storing speech or audio recordings, quality is likely to be compromised if other media files are converted into AMR.

## How to Open AMR files on PC/Smartphone/Tablet

Though AMR file format was not designed for music and videos, there are certain instances when you might come across them and be confused on how to open them. The fact is that it is still possible to open AMR files with your personal computer, tablet, Smartphone or other devices.

If the already installed programs in your computer are unable to open the file, then the other alternative would be to search and download an appropriate AMR player. There are several sources from the internet that you can get such media player for absolutely free. If you prefer this route however, you need to be cautious and ensure that you don't download a program file that will hurt your computer. Ensure that you download the program from a trusted website. This is the only to avoid downloading viruses, spyware, malware and other malicious programs that might compromise the safety and security of your computer.

## Convert the AMR audio file to another Audio format

This conversion process is not complicated in any way. There are basically two options for achieving this and they include the following-:

The first option is to use various websites that offer such conversion services. There are so many of them offering the services for free and all you have to do is to simply choose the ones that suits you the most.

AMR is an abbreviation for Adaptive Multi-Rate Audio Codec. It is a technology that utilizes audio compression formats primarily for speech. A typical AMR speech codec will have a multi-rate of eight bitrate values that range from 4.75kb/s to 12.2 kb/s. The structure of AMR allows the creation of a group of 160 twenty millisecond long samples by the codec in one frame. The multi-rate codec available for normal AMR files include ACELP, DTX, CAD and CNG.

In addition to compressing speech, the AMR file format can also be used for the storage of spoken audio using the same codec. There are a number of modern telephones that has the capability to store short audio recordings using the AMR format. There are also other programs, both free and proprietary that can be used to convert files from this format to other various formats and vice versa.
