![movavi reduce noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/movavi-reduce-noise.jpg)

Adjust the Noise Suppression pointer according to the video's need.

Playback the video on the timeline and check if the sound quality gets better.

Tips:

The Noise Suppression level needs to be adjusted for every video as the noise level will be different for every one of them. Using speakers while playing back the audio after noise suppression is also recommended to check the audio quality.
