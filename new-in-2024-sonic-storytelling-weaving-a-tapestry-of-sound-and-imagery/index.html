<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Videos and Music Files</strong></p>
<p>Launch Filmora after download. You can simply just drag&#x2F;drop or import the source videos and music that you need to make beats.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-source-music.jpg"
                      alt="import-source-music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>Right click the music file you want in the Media Library, select <strong>Beat Detection</strong>, and then Filmora will begin to detect the beats in the music file automatically. You can also go to the Audio tab and get 79 royalty-free music built in Filmora to make beats for your background music if you don’t have your source music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-beat-detection.jpg"
                      alt="get-beat-detection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag and Drop Videos and Music to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Filmora might take a while to install the detection plugin, and then you will see a bear marker “b” on the thumbnail of the music file. This means the Filmora is done detecting the beats for the video you selected. Then it is time to drag and drop the video and music to the video and audio track respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-to-track.jpg"
                      alt="add-to-track"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Own Beat Settings</strong></p>
<p>Beat markers in red can be seen on the filmora on every four beats. This is the default configuration. Four beat markers responding to every hit.The settings can be changed by selecting the Beat Options from the right-click menu on the music file in the Media Library. A pop-up window will open where you can make the necessary changes.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/configure-beat-setting.jpg"
                      alt="configure-beat-setting"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Sync Your Videos to the Music Beats</strong></p>
<p>Now that you are done marking beats, you can accurately sync the video as per your requirement on the video tracks via per music beat on the audio track. This whole treatment will make the music video smoother and more structured.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-beat-video.jpg"
                      alt="sync-beat-video "
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 6: Save and export your edited project</strong></p>
<p>After you finish all of your music video editing, you can click Export, select the format you want such as mp4 to export your music video. Filmora not only supports various video formats for the export, but also enables you to upload your music video to Youtube or Vimeo directly.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-panel.jpg"
                      alt="filmora9-export-panel "

<h2 id="Part-2-Best-Music-Beat-Making-Software-Alternatives"><a href="#Part-2-Best-Music-Beat-Making-Software-Alternatives" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Best Music Beat-Making Software Alternatives"></a>Part 2: Best Music Beat-Making Software Alternatives</h2><p>The diversity and abundance in different video editing projects spurs the development of different video editing software. Apart from Wondershare Filmora, here are some of other beat making apps for Smartphones, Mac and PC computers.</p>
<h4 id="1-Final-Cut-Pro-299-99"><a href="#1-Final-Cut-Pro-299-99" class="headerlink" title="1. Final Cut Pro ($299.99)"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>($299.99)</strong></h4><p>Final Cut Pro allows the user to sync the beats to the video in many ways. Final Cut Pro does not allow direct addition of the beats but the app works in collaboration with the BeatMark X to help you add the beat markers to the audio you choose as the video soundtrack. This is all done in BeatMark X and then the user is allowed to create XML file then can be then exported to the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>The process of adding beats is quite simple. All you have to do is add the music to the timeline. Playback and punch the M key to add a marker on each beat. Then finally lineup the inserted clips.</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> The platform does not allow an automated process for the addition of footage or creating cuts. And the price is not user friendly if you have a tight budget.</p>
<h4 id="2-Premiere-Elements-59-99-as-a-single-app"><a href="#2-Premiere-Elements-59-99-as-a-single-app" class="headerlink" title="2. Premiere Elements ($59.99 as a single app)"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html" >Premiere Elements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>($59.99 as a single app)</strong></h4><p>Premiere Elements helps simplify the entire video-making process. Adding beats to the video is a simple task here. All you have to do is add the required audio file to the timeline and then make use of the beat detection. This adds markers to the entire track. The beat detection setting can be customized as per the requirement. The customization takes just a few moments.</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> This feature can only be used in the expert view of the app only. The expert view app allows the user to add new markers just by punching the set bead maker option in the timeline.</p>
<h4 id="3-Splice-Free-but-offers-in-app-purchases"><a href="#3-Splice-Free-but-offers-in-app-purchases" class="headerlink" title="3. Splice (Free, but offers in-app purchases)"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>(Free, but offers in-app purchases)</strong></h4><p>Splice is one of the best available options for video editing in case you record lots and lots of videos on your iPad and iPhone. The app showcases all the required features that are needed to edit the videos like a pro. This app also features other editing tools that help to make cuts in the videos or applying filters to them. Splice syncs videos to the beats automatically and also add the transitions wherever required to make the video experience smoother.

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Videos and Music Files</strong></p>
<p>Launch Filmora after download. You can simply just drag&#x2F;drop or import the source videos and music that you need to make beats.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Import Source Videos and Music Files</strong></p>
<p>Launch Filmora after download. You can simply just drag&#x2F;drop or import the source videos and music that you need to make beats.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-source-music.jpg"
                      alt="import-source-music"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Start Beat Detection</strong></p>
<p>Right click the music file you want in the Media Library, select <strong>Beat Detection</strong>, and then Filmora will begin to detect the beats in the music file automatically. You can also go to the Audio tab and get 79 royalty-free music built in Filmora to make beats for your background music if you don’t have your source music.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-beat-detection.jpg"
                      alt="get-beat-detection"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drag and Drop Videos and Music to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>Filmora might take a while to install the detection plugin, and then you will see a bear marker “b” on the thumbnail of the music file. This means the Filmora is done detecting the beats for the video you selected. Then it is time to drag and drop the video and music to the video and audio track respectively.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add-to-track"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Configure Your Own Beat Settings</strong></p>
<p>Beat markers in red can be seen on the filmora on every four beats. This is the default configuration. Four beat markers responding to every hit.The settings can be changed by selecting the Beat Options from the right-click menu on the music file in the Media Library. A pop-up window will open where you can make the necessary changes.</p>

                      alt="configure-beat-setting"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Sync Your Videos to the Music Beats</strong></p>
<p>Now that you are done marking beats, you can accurately sync the video as per your requirement on the video tracks via per music beat on the audio track. This whole treatment will make the music video smoother and more structured.</p>

                      alt="sync-beat-video "
                ></p>

Apart from Wondershare Filmora, here are some of other beat making apps for Smartphones, Mac and PC computers.</p>
<h4 id="1-Final-Cut-Pro-299-99-3"><a href="#1-Final-Cut-Pro-299-99-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Final Cut Pro ($299.99)"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/" >Final Cut Pro <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>($299.99)</strong></h4><p>Final Cut Pro allows the user to sync the beats to the video in many ways. Final Cut Pro does not allow direct addition of the beats but the app works in collaboration with the BeatMark X to help you add the beat markers to the audio you choose as the video soundtrack. This is all done in BeatMark X and then the user is allowed to create XML file then can be then exported to the Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>The process of adding beats is quite simple. All you have to do is add the music to the timeline. Playback and punch the M key to add a marker on each beat. Then finally lineup the inserted clips.</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> The platform does not allow an automated process for the addition of footage or creating cuts. And the price is not user friendly if you have a tight budget.</p>
<h4 id="2-Premiere-Elements-59-99-as-a-single-app-3"><a href="#2-Premiere-Elements-59-99-as-a-single-app-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Premiere Elements ($59.99 as a single app)"></a>2. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-elements.html" >Premiere Elements <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>($59.99 as a single app)</strong></h4><p>Premiere Elements helps simplify the entire video-making process. Adding beats to the video is a simple task here. All you have to do is add the required audio file to the timeline and then make use of the beat detection. This adds markers to the entire track. The beat detection setting can be customized as per the requirement. The customization takes just a few moments.</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> This feature can only be used in the expert view of the app only. The expert view app allows the user to add new markers just by punching the set bead maker option in the timeline.</p>
<h4 id="3-Splice-Free-but-offers-in-app-purchases-3"><a href="#3-Splice-Free-but-offers-in-app-purchases-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Splice (Free, but offers in-app purchases)"></a>3. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/splice-video-editor-maker/id409838725" >Splice <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> <strong>(Free, but offers in-app purchases)</strong></h4><p>Splice is one of the best available options for video editing in case you record lots and lots of videos on your iPad and iPhone. The app showcases all the required features that are needed to edit the videos like a pro. This app also features other editing tools that help to make cuts in the videos or applying filters to them. Splice syncs videos to the beats automatically and also add the transitions wherever required to make the video experience smoother. The app features a huge royalty-free music library and also a built-in voice recorder.</p>
<p><strong>Review:</strong> The free version of the app offers very limited options and the user has to subscribe to monthly or annual subscriptions to enjoy the rest.</p>

One of the features of this update was that it included built-in music and song recognition button that makes it easier for the user to recognize any song playing around them.</p>
<p>You just need to add the iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center menu and simply press that button when you hear a song that you like. You will then get all the information related to that song; title, artist’s name, and album title.</p>
<p>Here is how you add the in-built iPhone music recognition button to the Control Center:</p>
<p>Note: Make sure that you have the latest version of the iOS installed on your iPhone as this feature is not available on older versions. To check the running version, go to Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About, and then you will see the software version.</p>
<p>Step 1 - Open Settings&gt; Control Center, and then tap <strong>More</strong> to scroll down.</p>
<p>Step 2- Tap the “+” button that is next to “Music Recognition”, and the iPhone music recognition button is added to the Control Center</p>

<p>If your iPhone has a home button, then swipe up to get into the Control Center menu and tap the music recognition button.</p>
<p>You will see the Music Recognition notification icon that shows which song is playing.</p>
<p>The iPhone will listen for around 10 to 15 seconds once you tap the button – and will attempt to identify the song in that time period.</p>

Siri can recognize a song playing in your environment and even the song you are humming. This how you do it:</p>
<p>Step 1- Activate Siri. You can do it two ways; the first is by long-pressing the home button or Wake&#x2F;Sleep button in iPhone X and the second is by the voice command “Hey Siri”.</p>
<p>Step 2- Then say, “Hey Siri, which song is this”. This starts Siri’s listening mode.</p>

<p>Mike has shown us how he uses Siri to identify the song playing on iPhone, let’s have a look!</p>
<h2 id="Best-Apps-for-iPhone-Music-Recognition"><a href="#Best-Apps-for-iPhone-Music-Recognition" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps for iPhone Music Recognition"></a>Best Apps for iPhone Music Recognition</h2><p>If your iPhone or iPad is not yet upgraded to iOS version 14.2 then you would have to use third part apps to identify songs. Following are the two best iPhone music recognition apps that you can use:</p>
<h3 id="1-SoundHound"><a href="#1-SoundHound" class="headerlink" title="1.  SoundHound"></a>1.  SoundHound</h3><p>SoundHound is one of the best iPhone music recognition app out there. It has some of the most useful features regards to song recognition that helps you get a complete music experience.</p>
<p>The standout feature of SoundHound is that you can have a song recognized in it by merely humming a short tune. This is very helpful when you don’t remember the lyrics of the song or the song’s title or who sang it.</p>
<p>The service is pretty quick meaning you can have songs and music identified in a matter of seconds. You will get all available details of the concerned song or tune and what more, you can also sing along to real-time lyrics in the app.</p>
<p>It also allows you to stream your playlists from other music apps like Spotify, YouTube and others. Your song search list is stored so that you don’t have to look for a song all over again if you have once searched it on SoundHound. This saves time and keeps your discovered songs organized.</p>
<p>You can use the app for The paid service of Shazam goes by the name of Shazam Encore and it costs $2.99.</p>
<h3 id="2-Shazam"><a href="#2-Shazam" class="headerlink" title="2.  Shazam"></a>2.  Shazam</h3><p>Shazam is the most popular music recognition app available out there, and its features will tell you why. To begin with, it does the basic task of any music recognition service with near 100% accuracy.</p>
<p>It draws up all available information of a song you want identifying, from its huge database in a short time. There is also a lyrics feature that displays lyrics in sync with the song being played so you can sing along with it.</p>
<p>But these are regular features that you can find in any music recognition app. What gives Shazam an edge over other apps is the following additional features: offline usage and Pop-Up Shazam. You can use Shazam offline. It records the song offline, and later when you go online, it provides all the information about that song.</p>
<p>The Pop-Up Shazam is a unique feature that helps you identify any song that is played in your smartphone. It works with any app and is especially helpful when you are surfing social media and want to know about a song or background music you just came across on it.</p>
<p>There is also an Auto Shazam feature that works like “Now Playing” on Pixel devices. This feature works in the background and gives you song info notifications as it recognizes songs in your environment. The only drawback of this feature is that it doesn’t work offline.</p>
<p>Shazam is a free iPhone music recognition app.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App"><a href="#How-to-Choose-a-Music-Recognition-App" class="headerlink" title="How to Choose a Music Recognition App?"></a>How to Choose a Music Recognition App?</h2><p>Version 14.2 has made it easy to recognize songs on your iDevices. But those who do not have it need a third-party app to do that job. You need to look for a good iPhone song recognition app, one that does the job to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>There are hundreds of such apps available on the Apple App Store, and you need to sift through them to get the best one. Following are the features you should consider while choosing the most appropriate app:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the time, you come across unknown songs in noisy surroundings. It can be at a party or the supermarket. Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.</p>
<p>Ideally, the app should recognize the song within a span of 5 to 10 seconds of launching.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As already been said, you are more likely to encounter an unknown song or tune you like in a noisy environment. Keeping that in mind, the song identifier app must be able to distinguish between the song you want to identify and the surrounding noise accompanying it.</p>
<p>The Trial and error method is the best way to determine which app does the best job in this case. Test the apps in a noisy environment before you decide which you will ultimately use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accuracy</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Identifying a song title, the artists, the album it belongs to with nearly 100% accuracy is a must for any music recognition app. Besides that basic info, it must give accurate allied information like music videos, covers and trivia regarding the singer and the song.</p>
<p>Don’t bother yourself with an app that doesn’t recognize at least 8 of 10 songs it hears.</p>
<h2 id="FAQs-About-Recognizing-Songs-on-iPhone"><a href="#FAQs-About-Recognizing-Songs-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Recognizing Songs on iPhone"></a>FAQs About Recognizing Songs on iPhone</h2><ol>
<li><strong>Should I install Shazam app on iPhone to recognize songs?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It depends on what version of iOS you are running. If the version is 14.2 and above, you don’t need to install Shazam separately as it comes integrated with your iPhone software. The in-built music recognition feature of the iPhone uses the Shazam database, and it recognizes songs and tunes the way the Shazam app does.</p>
<p>If you are running an older version, you need to install Shazam separately if you want to use it.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>What’s the difference between the Shazam app and the in-built Shazam music recognition feature?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>iOS users who haven’t upgraded to the iOS 14.2 update will not be able to access the features</p>
<p>When the process is complete, you’ll see a “Music Recognition” notification banner showing you what song is playing. This notification appears along with all your other apps’ notifications in your notification center.</p>
<p>Your iPhone will only listen for 10 to 15 seconds after you tap the button. If it can’t identify a song in that period of time, you’ll see a notification saying a song wasn’t detected.</p>

Your song recording can be interrupted by some loud noise like joyous shouts or announcements in both scenarios. Hence, it is vital that the music recognition app launches, listens and identifies in a few seconds before any interruption takes place.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Tenacity</strong></li>

You are missing out on audiences and profit if you constrain the publication of your book just into the form of paperbacks or eBooks. Nowadays, audiobooks actually make more sense with a large number of audiobook listeners worldwide.</p>
<p>Here are some potential advantages of audiobooks and why you should learn how to create an audiobook:</p>
<h4 id="1-More-profit-2"><a href="#1-More-profit-2" class="headerlink" title="1.More profit"></a>1.More profit</h4><p>According to the latest pieces of research, most Americans prefer listening to audiobooks rather than reading an eBook. And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.</p>
<p>Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side. Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.</p>
<h4 id="2-Larger-audience-2"><a href="#2-Larger-audience-2" class="headerlink" title="2.Larger audience"></a>2.Larger audience</h4><p>Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.</p>
<h4 id="3-No-worries-about-stock-2"><a href="#3-No-worries-about-stock-2" class="headerlink" title="3.No worries about stock"></a>3.No worries about stock</h4><p>When publishing a physical book, you have to constantly worry about keeping the print in stock and meeting readers’ demands. You can avoid such worries when you opt for audiobooks. In the case of audiobooks, there always exists a file accessible for readers to download and read.</p>
<h4 id="4-Easy-discovery-2"><a href="#4-Easy-discovery-2" class="headerlink" title="4.Easy discovery"></a>4.Easy discovery</h4><p>Your book will become easily discoverable when you publish it in the version of an audiobook also. Printed books are comparatively least discoverable online unless they have an audiobook version. The more discoverable your book is, the more is its reach to the targeted audience.</p>
<h4 id="5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-2"><a href="#5-Save-on-time-and-expenses-2" class="headerlink" title="5.Save on time and expenses"></a>5.Save on time and expenses</h4><p>The creation of audiobooks is comparatively easy and low in cost. You can either hire services like ACX and Audiobook Creation Exchange. Or else, you can nowadays also create audiobooks on your own by using online programs such as Filmii.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Create-an-Audiobook-Effortlessly-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Create-an-Audiobook-Effortlessly-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?"></a>Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?</h2><p>We have seen the advantages of transferring your book into audiobook format in the last section. Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.</p>
<ol>
<li>You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.</li>
<li>Record the audiobook yourself.</li>
</ol>
<p>At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.</p>
<p>Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.</p>
<ul>
<li>**Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.</li>
<li>**Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.</li>
<li>**Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.</li>
<li><strong>Step Four:</strong> Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that is how an audiobook is created. By uploading on ACX, you can make your audiobook available and discoverable on most audiobook platforms, including Amazon, Apple audiobook store, and Audible.</p>
<p>You have to open an account on ACX to upload your audiobook. An ACX account can be easily created by entering your Amazon account and tax details. After signing up, you have to choose whether you need an exclusive publication or a non-exclusive publication for your audiobook.</p>
<p>Exclusive publication of your audiobook allows you to get a higher commission or royalty share of 40%. But your audiobook won’t be published on other competing sites. In contrast, your audiobook will get published on multiple sites if you choose a non-exclusive publication. But the royalty share reduces to just 25%. That’s all about ACX.</p>
<p>Now let us see how to make an audiobook of your own.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Audiobook-Creatively-2"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Make-Your-Own-Audiobook-Creatively-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?"></a>Part 3: How to Make Your Own Audiobook Creatively?</h2><p>Most people don’t convert their books to audiobooks mainly for two reasons. Firstly, assuming that creating an audiobook is going to be an expensive task. Secondly, most of them don’t know how to create an audiobook on their own.</p>
<p>So, we are going to discuss how to make your own audiobook.</p>
