## "Harmonizing Visuals & Sounds: Displaying Audio Waves & Adding Expressive Animation in Magix Movie Edit Pro"

The amplitude and duration of an audio waveform vary with the duration and volume of the underlying sound. Finding specific edit locations when editing footage or keyframing effects is made simpler by these characteristics. Audio waveforms in Final Cut Pro alter based on the volume of a clip or any applied effects. When the volume is high, the waveform is larger; when the volume is low, it is smaller. But when using FCP to edit video, people frequently experience issues with **audio waveform disappearing**. Or you do want to **add some dynamic effects for audio waves**? Continue reading!

## Part 1\. How to show Audio Waveform on clips in FCP?

When working with audio waveforms on the timeline, you can zoom in or out, or change the appearance of the clip to make the waveform taller or shorter.

There are numerous methods to examine and interact with the audio and video contained within clips in Final Cut Pro. You can:

* Expand a clip to see and modify audio elements at the channel level
* Expand a clip to view separate audio and video
* Separate audio from video clip to work with audio and video as separate, independent clips
* Change the appearance of the clipped background to display **reference waveforms** that make it easier to view audio waveforms when the volume is reduced

The reference curve shows the maximum visual resolution possible for the current sound curve. By accounting for changes in volume, the reference waveforms allow you to see the details of the sound more clearly.

1. Choose Final Cut Pro > **Preferences**, then click Edit.
2. Check the **"Show reference waveforms"** box.

When the actual curve changes shape (for example, when it shrinks because the clip's volume level is low), its full reference curve is still visible for easy reference when editing.

![audio waveform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-1.png)

**Tips:** You can click the shortcut **“Control+Option+1”** to adjust the clip appearance setting to display clips on the timeline with large audio waveforms only.

## Part 2\. How to add audio waveform animation in FCP? (2 ways)

### 1\. Use Pixel Film Studios Audio Visualizer

With [FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2](https://store.pixelfilmstudios.com/product/fcpx-audio-visualizer-volume-2/) from Pixel Film Studios, users now have the ability to see up to 48 audio frequencies with full control over their left and right audio output, all within Final Cut Pro. Users have full control over smoothness, base scale, radius, angular offset, camera position, and animation, all with a single click of the mouse, all in Final Cut Pro X.

FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 has been professionally designed to work seamlessly inside Final Cut Pro X. As a title effect, FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 can be dragged onto media and previewed in real-time. With the published parameters found in the FCPX inspector, users have the ability to make further adjustments with just a few clicks of the mouse.

With the FCPX Audio Visualizer Volume 2 preset pack, users have the ability to compose multiple presets and create their own visualizer every time. Users can choose from template layouts ranging from circles, lines, rectangles, and individual shapes to even an animatable drag zone. Then, within Final Cut Pro, users have total control over spread, color, location, rotation, angle, angle offset, and much more.

### 2\. Use audio waveform animation templates

It could be more convenient to select a few relevant templates directly than using other plugins. You get a full set of 21 templates, including titles, fonts, media streaming logos, sound effects, and colors, with this set of [Waveform Audio Visualization by Motion Array](https://motionarray.com/final-cut-pro-templates/waveform-audio-visualization-305379/) themes. You only need to pick the style you prefer, add your music, and post it with ease on your social media sites. This template is best suited for audiobooks, podcasts, and music videos. Of course, you must subscribe to the platform to download it.

## Part 3\. The best alternative to add audio waveform animation to video?

### Create Audio WaveformVideo in [Filmora Audio Visualizer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

To add audio waveform animation to video, there is a wide variety of applications. However, Filmora video editor is one of the greatest programs we suggest because you can alter any sound effects on this platform with only one touch. With audio keyframing and an integrated equalization, Filmora can produce unusual sound effects that enhance the audio recording.

Under “Effects” tab, you can find 25 types of audio animation in **Audio Visualizer**.

![audio visualizer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/08/final-cut-pro-audio-waveform-2.png)

Or you can directly open **“Elements > Recommended”**, and type “audio visualizer” or “music pack” to choose preset waveform animation elements.

Click the Play button in the Preview window and when you feel good about the results, click Export to download the video and your library and successfully share it on various social media platforms.

## Conclusion

Social media content creators, musicians, and VJs can produce stunning videos with any of the music visualizers we've listed in this article. As a professional video editing software, although Final Cut Pro can provide powerful editing features, the operation is more cumbersome and not easy to get started. So, I will recommend using [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for the best experience.

## Elevating Your Video's Atmosphere with Exemplary Instrumental Soundscape

Are you a pianist? Or a content creator on YouTuber? Do you wish to access cool instrumental music?

Most content creators prefer instrumental background music in their videos. It is because the use of different instruments captures the audience's attention. The absence of vocals in the song makes it useful for viewers who love relaxing environments as they eat, meditate, sleep, and study.

The article gives an overview of top websites from which to download free instrumental music. The tips on choosing the best instrumental background music for videos will also be discussed. So, what are we waiting for? Let us start!

#### In this article

01 [How to Choose the Best Instrumental Background Music for Videos](#part1)

## Part 1: How to Choose the Best Instrumental Background Music for Videos

### 1\. Rhythm and Tempo

The most significant thing to notice is the rhythm and tempo of the music. The instrumental music comes at different speeds. The piano, guitar, cello, guitar, violin, and harmonica can create nuisance and be slowed down as per the player. It is important to choose royalty-free instrumental music whose tempo syncs with the video.

### 2\. Content-Type of Video

The type of content in the video is essential to be studied. It is because the right information will lead to the right choice. If the video content is a product promo or description, there is nothing wrong with going a little high with tempo. However, if the video genre is business-related, avoid MP3 instrumental music with more movement and energy.

### 3\. Targeted Audience and their Preference

For the audience, one should know their preferences. Conduct market research to know what your viewers respond to. You can also watch your competitors' videos to understand their reactions to different instrumental music. The background instrumental music should be according to the audience's needs to engage them better.

### 4\. Frequency and Tone

The frequency and tone of the music matter with the video. If the video has more dialogues and talking, the users should pick the instrumental background music with the same notes as human voices. The emotional tones of the guitar, violin, cello, viola, and keyboard would help in this situation as they would complement the voice in the video.

### 5\. Video Length

The video length is yet another important pointer while selecting copyright-free instrumental music. If the video is big, the instrumental background music to fill it won't last long. Therefore, pick instrumental music that syncs with the video length. You can also use the 30 or 60 seconds loop version to continue the background instrumental track.

### 6\. Video Message

As far as the video's message is concerned, it is recommended to keep the content in mind while making a choice. The MP3 instrumental music includes five classes such as percussion, woodwind, brass, keyboard, and string. Make sure that your video story is not neglected with your music choice.
