Alternatively, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+I keyboard shortcut to select the file you’d like to import into the software.

The file will be displayed as a waveform and placed on the software’s timeline. You can then proceed to **select the portion of the file you’d like to reverse** by holding the left mouse button while dragging the mouse cursor between any two points within the file. Use the Ctrl+A shortcut to select the entire file or head over to the Edit menu, click on the Select option and **choose All** from the submenu.

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-reverse-audio.jpg)

## Best Audio Reverser Apps for iOS and Android

Listening to reversed versions of your favorite songs on your Smartphone can be a lot of fun, so if you would like to explore the possibilities of reversing audio directly from an iPhone or Android device you should check out these apps.

#### 1. [Reverse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hipxel.audio.reverse.music.audio.player&hl=en%5FUS)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-music-player-android-audio-reverser.jpg)

The Reverse Music Player is an Android-based app that lets you reverse sounds or music with ease. What’s more, you can make a song’s tempo up to 4 times faster or slower or adjust its Pitch. The app supports wav, mp3, ogg and flac audio file formats, but if you are using a large audio file reversing a song may take some time. A three-minute song can temporarily take up to 20MB of storage space on your phone’s memory card, while longer songs may take even more, so it is important to make sure that you have enough free space on your phone before you start using this app.

#### 2. [Reverse Audio](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reverse-audio/id1254981556?mt=8)

![ Best Audio Reversers ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reverse-audio-ios-audio-reverser.jpg)

iPhone users can reverse audio files they record with this app in just a few simple steps. The app lets you record an audio file and then it automatically plays the recording backwards. While you’re playing the audio, you can alter the Playback Rate or the Pitch. The Reverse Audio app also enables you to import audio files from other apps via the Share option, but audio files cannot be directly imported into the app. The limited amount of audio editing options makes this iOS-based app a moderately reliable choice for reversing audio files.

**Conclusion**

Playing songs or audio effects backwards can have unexpected results, which makes the process of reversing audio incredibly entertaining. These free and easy to use audio reversers can help you create high-quality sound effects that might make the videos you used them for, go viral.

**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work.

## How to Make the Process of Transcribing Podcasts Quicker for Free

You don’t have to spend money on subscriptions to voice-to-text software products every month since Google Docs offers a simple and free solution. You can enable the Voice Typing feature from the Tools menu and then just proceed to record your podcasts.

This tool will transcribe everything you say, although its accuracy depends on the quality of the audio recording. In addition, the Voice Typing feature can be used to transcribe the podcasts you already recorded, but you have to repeat exactly what is being said in the episode you are transcribing.

You shouldn’t expect a high level of accuracy, since the Voice Typing tool is still being improved, and you should keep in mind that proofreading a transcript can help you eliminate all mistakes that occurred during the automatic transcription process.

### Utilizing YouTube to Transcribe Podcast

One of the easiest ways to create captions for YouTube videos is to utilize the platform’s Transcribe feature. Every time you upload a new podcast to your YouTube channel, you’ll be able to generate captions for that video file automatically.

However, the [voice to text technology](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) the platform is using doesn’t always create accurate transcriptions, which is the reason why you must go through the entire transcription and make sure that the text matches its source.

Moreover, YouTube recently made the automatic captioning feature available during live streams, which enables you to generate transcriptions of your podcasts even while the recording session is in progress.

**Conclusion**

Extending the reach of your audience is an essential step towards creating a loyal base of subscribers who follow your work. Transcribing each episode of the podcast you are running can help you improve your SEO strategy and draw more attention to your work.
