No doubt, the PowerDirector audio ducking feature offers the simplistic way, but it lacks flexibility.

However, this could have been done pretty quickly in Wondershare Filmora's video editor, making it the best alternative to CyberLink PowerDirector. Keeping it the top priority, begin your journey today!
