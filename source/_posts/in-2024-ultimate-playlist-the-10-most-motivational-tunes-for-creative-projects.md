## Ultimate Playlist: The 10 Most Motivational Tunes for Creative Projects

What's a montage video, you ask? It's the short video you need to save the day. Whether it's in a sports game, a video game, or just your life, montage songs find their way into every aspect of our media. It can showcase your struggle and success as it makes you feel awesome. A montage video is a very powerful way to tell a story, reveal your brand's personality, and demonstrate the power of your product.

Video montage songs are meant to be fun and entertaining. They're like a soundtrack to your montage while bringing out the best parts of the scene. Music can improve a video montage by providing emotional context, elevating the atmosphere, and encouraging viewer engagement. There are many montage videos, such as supercuts, sports edits, comedy clips, and more. All these montages have their tone, style, and subject matter. For this reason, you need to select music that fits in with the rest of your video.

There are many songs out there suitable for montages, but not all of them will make a suitable choice. If you want your video to appeal to everyone and bring people more joy, then you might want to consider these Top 10 Best Montage Songs for Your Montage Video!

## How A Well-Picked Song Enhances Your Montage Video

If you have ever been to YouTube and searched for montage videos, then you must have noticed that they all have one thing in common. They have a great soundtrack.

The music is what makes the montage video so special. The right song can make your montage video go viral, while the wrong one can make it fail miserably.

Here are some tips to help you pick the right music for your next montage:

#### 1\. Choose music that matches the mood of your video

Many people make the mistake of choosing songs that don't fit their videos at all. For example, if you're making a movie about love and romance, it doesn't make sense to use a heavy metal song about death and destruction. If you do, then your viewers will find it hard to connect with your movie because they will be distracted by the mismatch between what they see and what they hear.

#### 2\. Pick songs that match the genre of your video

If you're making a romantic comedy movie, then try picking up some romantic pop songs instead of heavy metal ones or classical ones. This way, your viewers will know right away what type of movie they're watching and will be able to enjoy themselves more because they know what to expect from it visually and audibly.

#### 3\. The length of your montage video

If you have a long montage video (over 1 minute), you may want to use shorter songs (under 3 minutes) to fit seamlessly into each other without any awkward pauses or breaks in sound.

#### 4\. Keep in mind that there are two types of songs - instrumental and vocal

Vocal songs have lyrics that can be sung along while listening to them, whereas instrumental ones don't have any words but only music in them. It depends on what kind of effect you want to create in your audience's minds when they listen to it. For example, if you want people to feel happy about something or if it's about a celebration, then an instrumental one will work better than a vocal one because most people don't like singing along with instrumental songs since they don't know what the actual lyrics are.

#### 5\. Think about the emotions you want to convey

The most important thing when choosing a song is that it matches the emotion of your montage video. For example, if you want to express joyfulness, then you should choose a happy song with a rhythm that can bring up people’s spirits; if you want to express sadness, then you should choose a sad song with an emotional melody; if you want to express anger or hatred, then use heavy metal music; if you want to express love, then use romantic music; etc.

These are some tips to consider when adding music to your montage videos. Music is an important part of a video montage. It's the second most important part after the video itself. A good song can make your montage more enjoyable and memorable. The wrong one can ruin it completely.

Sound is pretty essential in almost every video. But why? It engages the audience and gives an awakening to emotional responses. It generally helps you create a mood for your entire video. Suppose you have an elevator scene, you may want to make it look realistic by adding the ding sound to give your whole set some effect. Looking for applause sound effect to create a fun element in your videos or presentation? Well, you have come to the right place.

Ever wonder why some videos on YouTube get massive views even with average content? Applause audio is mostly used in presentations or videos to create a sense of motivation. It can make the scenes on the screen more alive and enjoyable. But how do you find the perfect audio that matches your requirement? The key is to use sound to tell your audience a story.

This article will discuss different ways of downloading sound effects and one particular software that caters to all your video editing needs. Sounds interesting? Then without wasting any more time, let's get into it.

#### In this article

01 [Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect](#Part 1)

02 [Use Filmora to Add Background Music to Your Video](#Part 2)

## Part 1  Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

### Method 1: Download Using YouTube Downloader

Y2 Mate is an effective working website and gives you the option to convert YouTube videos to mp3\. Y2mate allows you to convert & download videos from YouTube, Facebook, Video, Dailymotion, etc., to Mp3 and MP4 in HD quality. Y2mate supports downloading all video formats such as MP4, M4V, 3GP, MP3, etc. You can easily download thousands of videos from YouTube and other sites. All you have to do is –

**Step 1:** Go to Youtube.com from your web browser.

**Step 2:** Search the type of Applause/Crowd music you require and click on that.

**Step 3:** Copy the link to the video.

**Step 4:** Go to <https://www.y2mate.com/en142>.

![YTB](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/applause-effect-6.JPG)

**Step 5:** Paste the link of the copied YouTube Video and click enter.

**Step 6:** There will be a conversion to the mp3 button for your applause sound effect.

Click “Start” to begin the converting procedure.

**Step 7:** After mp3 conversion, click download, and it will automatically be downloaded and saved to your desktop.

### Method 2: Make an Applause Sound Effect Yourself

You cannot always pick and choose ready-made sound effects from the internet. Sometimes, you need custom sounds specific to the context of your video. Regardless of thousands of options you find on YouTube or sound software. Your applause sound effect might not sync with the visuals in your video. You need to create your sounds and be your foley artist.

Shocking, isn’t it? But, this method is proven to be extremely realistic. Not everybody gives it a thought, but most of the sounds you hear in your favorite movies or TV shows are created artificially. For example, a creaking door sound or a slap on a character's face are created by foley artists using different objects. Similarly, for an applause or crowd sound, gather a group of people, make a proper audience setting, and record them clapping. And that’s when you get your sound effect which is realistic to the extreme.

If you need sound effects for a professional purpose rather than personal use, we recommend using a dedicated audio recorder. The recorder allows you to save the files and edit or omit anything you want. Once you use it, you will notice how it unfolds all the details, even in a simple sound. You can use the original zoom H4N and pack it up with a shotgun microphone.

I guess you have decided which tool you will be using. Here are some things for you to remember –

* Going to lecture halls is a great way of recording clear audience applause sound effects. Normally, people behave well in the lobby and don't scream or yell while clapping.
* If you want crowd applause sound effects with lots of cheering and booing, you should go to a football stadium. Whenever a team scores a goal, one side of the stadium will mourn, but the other will explode with applause and laughter.
* You can try different games to get a variety of sounds. Normally the crowd size and game type determine how the applause sounds will be. So choose accordingly.
* Suppose the video shows a scene of the ocean like the photo above. Then don't just use the sound of waves and get it over with. Layer it with some other subtle sounds like the chirping of birds and breezes. Covering one sound over another is a great way to make the viewer fully immerse into the video.

### Method 3: Use Royalty-Free Websites

Thankfully now we have websites with huge collections of audio snippets and recordings. It will require another article to talk about only the popular free sites. But let's talk about two highly incredible websites. The first one is Freesound. You already guessed what it does from the name. More than 500k sound clips are at your disposal for free.

And the second website is Avosound. Everything is categorized and arranged under a label. So that it is easier for you to find anything you want, you can just log in and use the files for personal use however you like. But remember to give credit to the original artist if you are using it in a video. The only copyright claim that Freesound demands are when you try to sell it to another party.

If you want to download several yet similar sounds,99sounds is your best choice. 99Sounds is a directory that offers royalty-free themed collections of different sounds.

![99sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/applause-effect-1.JPG)

You can check out this small tutorial for downloading sound clips from these websites.

**Step 1:** Go to the website. Log in using your username and accept their terms and conditions.

**Step 2:** You will enter into the big library of sound samples.

Search for your desired one using a keyword like" applause sound effect".

**Step 3:** The results will narrow down to the only relevant ones.

Play them one by one and select the appropriate one.

**Step 4:** Next, go to the import section and send it to your media library.

The applause sound effect mp3 file is downloaded. It's as easy as this.

### Method 4: Outsource Sound Effects

The last method is a paid one. Yes, sometimes we value our time more than money. You might not have the time and patience to create the sound effect you want. The easier way is to get it done by sound artists. There are plenty of SFX experts waiting for you in the marketplace. All you have to do is post the task and the time limit and budget. You will easily find freelancers who offer such services at an affordable price.

The best thing about outsourcing is that you are not confined to a specific location. You can make use of the best talents across the world.

## Part 1  Ways to Download All Kinds of Sound Effect

### Method 1: Download Using YouTube Downloader

Y2 Mate is an effective working website and gives you the option to convert YouTube videos to mp3\. Y2mate allows you to convert & download videos from YouTube, Facebook, Video, Dailymotion, etc., to Mp3 and MP4 in HD quality. Y2mate supports downloading all video formats such as MP4, M4V, 3GP, MP3, etc. You can easily download thousands of videos from YouTube and other sites. All you have to do is –

**Step 1:** Go to Youtube.com from your web browser.

**Step 2:** Search the type of Applause/Crowd music you require and click on that.

**Step 3:** Copy the link to the video.

**Step 4:** Go to <https://www.y2mate.com/en142>.

![YTB](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/applause-effect-6.JPG)

**Step 5:** Paste the link of the copied YouTube Video and click enter.

**Step 6:** There will be a conversion to the mp3 button for your applause sound effect.

Click “Start” to begin the converting procedure.

**Step 7:** After mp3 conversion, click download, and it will automatically be downloaded and saved to your desktop.

### Method 2: Make an Applause Sound Effect Yourself

You cannot always pick and choose ready-made sound effects from the internet. Sometimes, you need custom sounds specific to the context of your video. Regardless of thousands of options you find on YouTube or sound software. Your applause sound effect might not sync with the visuals in your video. You need to create your sounds and be your foley artist.

Shocking, isn’t it? But, this method is proven to be extremely realistic. Not everybody gives it a thought, but most of the sounds you hear in your favorite movies or TV shows are created artificially. For example, a creaking door sound or a slap on a character's face are created by foley artists using different objects. Similarly, for an applause or crowd sound, gather a group of people, make a proper audience setting, and record them clapping. And that’s when you get your sound effect which is realistic to the extreme.

If you need sound effects for a professional purpose rather than personal use, we recommend using a dedicated audio recorder. The recorder allows you to save the files and edit or omit anything you want. Once you use it, you will notice how it unfolds all the details, even in a simple sound. You can use the original zoom H4N and pack it up with a shotgun microphone.

I guess you have decided which tool you will be using. Here are some things for you to remember –

* Going to lecture halls is a great way of recording clear audience applause sound effects. Normally, people behave well in the lobby and don't scream or yell while clapping.
* If you want crowd applause sound effects with lots of cheering and booing, you should go to a football stadium. Whenever a team scores a goal, one side of the stadium will mourn, but the other will explode with applause and laughter.
* You can try different games to get a variety of sounds. Normally the crowd size and game type determine how the applause sounds will be. So choose accordingly.
* Suppose the video shows a scene of the ocean like the photo above. Then don't just use the sound of waves and get it over with. Layer it with some other subtle sounds like the chirping of birds and breezes. Covering one sound over another is a great way to make the viewer fully immerse into the video.

### Method 3: Use Royalty-Free Websites

Thankfully now we have websites with huge collections of audio snippets and recordings. It will require another article to talk about only the popular free sites.

So that it is easier for you to find anything you want, you can just log in and use the files for personal use however you like.
