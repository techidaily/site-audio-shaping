### Youtube Audio Library

You may find YouTube’s Audio Library under the "Create" feature. It includes a diverse range of musical styles. You are free to utilize any music in your video project.

The soundtrack is a combination of public domain, and Creative Commons licensed pieces. All you would need to do is credit the track's creator.

Just use library's search capabilities taking full advantage of it. You may, for example, search by emotion, such like "happy," "sad," or "boss battle." You may search for tracks based on their duration, which is a fantastic way to ensure that they suit the timeframe of your material.

### AudioBlocks

Music, sound effects, and clips are all available for royalty-free use at Audioblocks. Here on the platform, they offer over a hundred thousand tracks. Regrettably, it is no longer free.

However, the company provides an excellent deal: $149 for a year of unlimited downloads. That's a great deal when you realize you have access to tens of thousands of songs.

Users can narrow down their search to music that is just the perfect length for their content. That's a fantastic method to cut down on your editing efforts.

## Part 2 Make Laughing Sound Effect by Yourself
