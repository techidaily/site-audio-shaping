<h2 id="What-is-a-Video-Podcast"><a href="#What-is-a-Video-Podcast" class="headerlink" title="What is a Video Podcast?"></a>What is a Video Podcast?</h2><p>In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can’t listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference"><a href="#Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference" class="headerlink" title="Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?"></a>Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Content</strong></p>
<p>The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p>The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Versions</strong></p>
<p>You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo&#x2F; Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting"></a>Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</h2><p>There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won’t be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.</p>
<p>Pros of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>Easy Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.</p>
<p>A video podcast is the better alternative if you don’t have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn’t need a paid subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Encourages productivity</strong></p>
<p>The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn’t matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers’ minds.</p>
<p>Cons of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>The challenging process of finding a relevant audience</strong></p>
<p>It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.</p>
<p><strong>Time Consuming</strong></p>
<p>Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won’t be beneficial in the long run. It’s essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.</p>
<p><strong>Distracting</strong></p>
<p>You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That’s the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-a-Video-Podcast-3"><a href="#What-is-a-Video-Podcast-3" class="headerlink" title="What is a Video Podcast?"></a>What is a Video Podcast?</h2><p>In simple words, a video podcast is generally a video format of audio podcasts. Overall, it is video content than mere audio content. Thus, they can’t listen to MP3 players. You must have a high-end digital media player, iTunes, and other video hosting platforms to listen to these kinds of podcasts. You can call it by a different name like vodcasting or videocasting as well. It is a version of podcasting despite other formats or versions of podcasts, including interview format, startup format, etc.</p>
<h2 id="Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference-3"><a href="#Video-Podcast-v-s-Vlog-What’s-the-Difference-3" class="headerlink" title="Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?"></a>Video Podcast v&#x2F;s Vlog: What’s the Difference?</h2><p>There is a visual difference between a vlog and a video podcast. Even though you can share both the content formats on a robust platform like YouTube, a video podcast is still different from a vlog in many terms.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Content</strong></p>
<p>The very first Difference is the type of content posted on both platforms. Vlogging is a kind of informal content presentation, whereas a vodcast is presented most formally in different versions.</p>
<p><strong>Style</strong></p>
<p>The vloggers generally show their lifestyles in various forms while also spreading social messages in some of their videos. A vlog may or may not be informative to the audience. On the other hand, a video podcaster is obliged to present its audience with informative content. Whether in the version of a startup, interview, conversational, or a repurposed content, almost every video podcast is highly instructive.</p>
<p><strong>Type of Versions</strong></p>
<p>You can have a video podcast in different versions or formats, including Interviews, Startup Conversations, Laptop Lifestyles, First Launch Conversations, Solo&#x2F; Monologue, Co-Hosting, or Hosting Regular Show. On the other hand, vlogging comes in various versions or types, namely Lifestyle, Makeup, Gaming, Fitness, Unboxing, and Reviews. It is generally informally represented to showcase reality to the audience.</p>
<h2 id="Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting-3"><a href="#Pros-and-Cons-of-Video-Podcasting-3" class="headerlink" title="Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting"></a>Pros and Cons of Video Podcasting</h2><p>There are many such merits and demerits of video podcasts if you decide to do it on a large scale. As mentioned earlier, it won’t be that easy if you are not consistent and committed. It will also help if you consider the following advantages and disadvantages of video podcasting as follows.</p>
<p>Pros of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>Easy Accessibility</strong></p>
<p>An easy reach and wide accessibility is the first significant advantage of hosting a podcast. Every second person nowadays is fond of listening to podcasts, whether in audio or video formats. A podcast is a whole pack of informational content that doesn’t need further FAQs and similar issues to mention separately. On the other hand, accessibility is also comprehensive as everyone is utilizing the platform like YouTube.</p>
<p>A video podcast is the better alternative if you don’t have the required setup and budget to promote your business operations.</p>
<p><strong>Convenient</strong></p>
<p>Podcasts or Video Podcasts are more convenient options, especially on YouTube. Despite getting high value, a video podcast can listen everywhere when you have YouTube. Due to convenience, they are pretty similar to listening to an audio podcast, which is also free of cost except for your internet charges. A YouTube-hosted video podcast doesn’t need a paid subscription.</p>
<p><strong>Encourages productivity</strong></p>
<p>The very idea of presenting a podcast is to offer authentic information formally. It doesn’t matter what format you choose to host the best video podcast; it contains reliable information and the elements to encourage productivity in viewers’ minds.</p>
<p>Cons of Video Podcasts</p>
<p><strong>The challenging process of finding a relevant audience</strong></p>
<p>It may be super tough to find the relevant audience in the beginning. You may have to advertise on YouTube to see the audience. Else, a strategic marketing policy for your channel to ensure consistency and retention of followers or audience.</p>
<p><strong>Time Consuming</strong></p>
<p>Making a video podcast is generally a time-consuming procedure, specifically when you are new to the technical aspects. Well, a person who is passionate about podcasting can even hire a video editor to fulfill the editing and similar tasks. But that won’t be beneficial in the long run. It’s essential to learn video podcasting and further video editing to cut costs on a long-term basis.</p>
<p><strong>Distracting</strong></p>
<p>You should not create a podcast if it is distracting the audience within the first five minutes. That’s the primary concern as creating visually appealing video podcasts is more than challenging, especially for a beginner. Due to the podcasting hype, many creators develop video podcasts that are not even useful and highly distracting for the audience.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-create-a-Video-Podcast-3"><a href="#How-to-create-a-Video-Podcast-3" class="headerlink" title="How to create a Video Podcast?"></a>How to create a Video Podcast?</h2><p>Let’s review the step-by-step guide to create a video podcast, as mentioned below!</p>
<p>Step 1: Content Preparation</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/content-preparation-for-video-podcast.jpg"
                      alt="Content Preparation For Video Podcast"
                ></p>
<p>So yes, the content preparation is essential and foremost! Check the field and podcast format for which you can create the most awesome content. You must also address the target audience as your first step using various research tools, such as Facebook Groups, Twitter, Reddit, Quora, etc. You can also look at several types of podcast formats discussed above to get started.</p>
<p>Step 2: Recording</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Record Podcast"
                ></p>
<p>A recording is all about using the ideal equipment and setup. It also depends upon your selection of format. For instance, a video podcast in an interview may not need the other guest as in-person if they have a virtual presence. You can record with the on-screen recorder then. Remember to follow the basics of recording, such as facing the camera and remaining in the frame.</p>
<p>Step 3: Editing</p>
<p>Now, there’s a turn to edit the raw video. Editing can be in various forms and can be time-consuming if you are not doing it right. For this purpose, a good video editor is more than crucial. Generally, you are required to adjust the audio and pop in a little video effect with interactive video intros and outros. We want to recommend you the updated and easy to use video editor, namely the Wondershare Filmora X.

<p>This is a next-level audio video mixer that we find to be an excellent option for mixing, recording, editing, and restoring files. This mixing software allows you easily record music or podcast for various platforms. In addition, it offers a sharing feature that will enable you to share directly from the platform. Adobe Audition provides two mixing modes: the waveform view and the multitrack view. While the Waveform view is ideal for stereo editing, the multitrack view allows users to edit tracks on a timeline. Luckily Audition enables you to switch between both views whenever you want, so you don’t have to choose one.</p>
<p>One of the impressive features that make Adobe Audition one of the best audio video mixers in 2022 is the ability to remove silence from inactive parts in the audio file. While doing this, you don’t have to lose sync in the file. As a result, it is ideal for podcasts and interview audios. It also features a loudness radar that allows you to analyze submix, single tracks, full mix, and many more according to several broadcast requirements.</p>
<p>Another nice feature we found impressive with Audition is the DeReverb tool that allows you to eliminate or remove reverberations from the audio file. IT efficiently handles short delays and spacious reverbs in your video and audio files. The sound remover tool is another impressive tool that allows you to remove car alarms, errant bumps, paper shuffling, and other unnecessary sounds from your audio and video file. You also gain access to the music remix tool that allows you to cut new versions of songs without necessarily sending them to the remixer.</p>
<p>You can efficiently adjust the song’s target duration to help you get the perfect fit. You can also customize the splices or favor rhythm elements to ensure the beats remain locked when necessary. All the functions available on Adobe Audition are useful for your audio and video mixes.</p>
