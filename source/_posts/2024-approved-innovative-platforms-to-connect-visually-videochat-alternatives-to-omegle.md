There are so many platforms that provide its users with the ability to connect, chat and make new friends such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. But there is another platform that is totally different from all these which is known as Omegle. It has the same features as other social media platforms, but the best thing about Omegle is its feature of connecting with others anonymously. It helps you chat through text messages and video calls with other users without letting them know your identity and personal information. It allows you to talk to random people throughout the world without the fear of being exposed or leaking your information. But with the passage of time, Omegle has become an overpopulated platform and it has lost the original feel of connecting with other people and making friends.
