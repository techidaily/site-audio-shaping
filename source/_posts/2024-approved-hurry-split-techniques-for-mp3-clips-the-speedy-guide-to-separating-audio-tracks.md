The recordings of important business meetings or stunning moments from the events you attended contain both sound and video. Creating a new audio file from a video clip is a routine operation that enables you to combine the sound of one clip with any number of video clips you include in your projects or use it as a separate audio file. You don’t even need a desktop-based video editing software to extract audio from video files since a growing number of online platforms offer this service for free. That’s why, in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best online tools that allow you to separate audio from video files in just a few easy steps.

## Top 6 Online Audio Extractors

Afterward, you just have to **select the output format** and click on the **Start button** and once the conversion process is completed, you can save the file to a destination on your device or use the **QR code** to download it to a **Smartphone or tablet**.

#### 2 Add audio to MKV

 Now what you have to do is to drop the video file to the Video track in the Timeline and audio to the Audio Track. Then you can make the audio file fit your video by trimming or double click the audio file to set fade in/out effects, speed up or slow down it, adjust volume so that it doesn't drown out the original audio of your video, etc. If you want to remove the original audio, just right click the video in Timeline and select “Audio Detach” and press “Delete” to remove audio from video.

 Besides adding an audio file, you can also use Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor) to record and add your own voiceover.
