One surprising feature this tool offers is its multi-audio track feature. Sometimes we need to add not just background music, but also additional voiceovers for a home video we create. It is almost impossible to add both two audio tracks to a video at the same time. However, by using Filmora, you will be able to add up to 3 audio tracks at a time. That means your voiceover, background music, even some funny or emotional sound effects can be added to a video clip simultaneously with one click of the button.
