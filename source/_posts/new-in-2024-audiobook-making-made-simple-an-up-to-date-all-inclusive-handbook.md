## Part 1: What Are the Benefits of Making an Audiobook?

The benefits of getting your book published in the format of an audiobook are numerous.

According to the latest pieces of research, most Americans prefer listening to audiobooks rather than reading an eBook. And as a result, the audiobook industry has now become very profitable.

Apart from the popularity, the cost of making an audiobook from an existing book is comparatively on the lower side. Therefore, the profit of converting books into audiobooks is pretty high.

#### 2.Larger audience

Audiobooks comparatively have a larger audience. The audience of audiobooks is not limited to those who are capable of reading. For example, a person with low or blind vision cannot read an eBook, but he can effortlessly listen to an audiobook. Likewise, an audiobook takes your piece of writing to a completely different and larger group of audience.

#### 3.No worries about stock

## Part 2: How To Create an Audiobook Effortlessly?

We have seen the advantages of transferring your book into audiobook format in the last section. Now the question is how to make an audiobook effortlessly. There are actually two ways in which you can create an audiobook.

1. You can get the professional help of an audiobook production company.
2. Record the audiobook yourself.

At first thought, you may feel like recording the audiobook yourself will help you save the cost of the process. But actually, recording the audiobook yourself will be more expensive in terms of money and time.

Anyways, let us see the basic steps of the creation of an audiobook.

* **Step One:**Prepare the contents of your book for recording. If it is an eBook, better delete the hyperlinks, visuals, and call to action that may cause distractions to the narrator. Ensure that the content or script can be easily read and makes some sense when listened to as an audiobook.
* **Step Two:**Find a narrator. It can be yourself or someone hired for the purpose. You can actually hire an audiobook narrator for the purpose. Surprisingly, audiobook narrators are super-affordable, and they will get the task done effortlessly.
* **Step Three:**Get the audio files recorded by the narrator mastered or edited by an audiobook producer to ensure the quality of the final production file. You can do it yourself if your technical knowledge is sound and good enough.
* **Step Four:** Now, the last step is uploading your audiobook into ACX or Audiobook Creation Exchange.
