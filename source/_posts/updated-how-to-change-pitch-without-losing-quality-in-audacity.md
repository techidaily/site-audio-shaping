## How to Change Pitch without Losing Quality in Audacity?

You may raise or lower the pitch of a pre-recorded song. Likewise, you may apply the pitch-changing effect in real-time sound recording. Change in pitch affects your noise in certain ways. For instance, it can help you sound younger. Similarly, it can convert the male voice into a female voice. Another notable use of the pitch-changing technique is that you can produce sounds like cartoons. So, changing pitch can add a unique touch to your voice. You can also change pitch when recording in Audacity. The following article covers details about the **Audacity change pitch** feature. Let’s get started.

01 [What is pitch, and how does it work?](#part1)

02 [How to Change Pitch in Audacity?](#part2)

## Part 1: What is pitch, and how does it work?

Not all sounds are the same. Some vary in terms of amplitude, which makes them loud or quiet. In contrast, others vary in terms of pitch, which makes them high or low. Pitch is used to differentiate between the acute and flat notes in a sound wave. High-pitched sounds are likely to be shrilling, whereas the lower-pitched will be bassy. Pitch depends upon the frequency of the sound waves producing them. In short, notes at a higher frequency are high-pitched.

On the contrary, notes at lower frequencies are low-pitched. Changing a pitch of noise from low to high or vice versa is an art. Thus, sound recording and editing applications like Audacity come with the in-built effect that enables you to change the pitch of a sound.

## Part 2: How to Change Pitch in Audacity?

Sound editing is becoming increasingly popular in music and other relevant industries. Several applications offer sound editing tools to serve the needs of the people. Pitch-changing is one of the common tools that people look for in sound editors.

Audacity is one of the notable software that allows users to change the pitch of the voice. It comes with an **Audacity pitch shift** mechanism to facilitate users. So, if you are editing sound in Audacity, changing the pitch is just a matter of a few clicks. Are you still wondering how you can apply the **Audacity change pitch** technique when editing? Here’s how you can do it in simple steps.

Whether you are in the business of shooting or editing, noisy or distorted footage is among the most frustrating roadblocks you'll ever encounter in your workflow. The magic of filmmaking lies after the scenes in post-production. You can remove distortion from audio using various methods.

#### In this article

01 [What Is Distortion in Audio?](#part1)

02 [The Difference Between Noise and Distortion](#part2)

03 [How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video](#part3)

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

## The Difference Between Noise and Distortion

Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let's look at the differences between noise and distortion.

#### 1\. Where It Appears in a Signal

Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.

#### 2\. How It Affects Signals

Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.

#### How It's Measured

You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal's waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal's magnitude and frequency content over time.

Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.

## How to Remove Distortion From Audio for Your Video

You can use several different methods to remove audio distortion in your video. They include:

### Method 1: Use an Online Audio Distortion Tool

You can use an online distortion tool to fix this problem. One of the popular tools for removing distortion from audio is Audacity. Available for Linux, macOS, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems, Audacity is a FOSS (free and open-source digital audio editor software). It is also a recording application software, and you can use the program for varying tasks, including conversing audio files, removing audio distortion, adding effects, and mixing audio clips.

Keeping this in mind, let's look at how to remove distortion from audio using Audacity.

1. The first step is opening the file. To do this, drag and drop the audio file into Audacity.
1. Next, you need to select the distorted area before clicking on Effect. Once you have done this, click on the Noise Reduction option.

![remove audio distortion from video using audacity](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/remove-distortion-from-audio-1.png)

## What Is Distortion in Audio?

You have probably heard the term distortion and would like to know what it is. Distortion is a common term in music production.

Although the term is simple, there is more than meets the eye. Distortion is defined as the change or deformation of an audio waveform that results in the production of an audio output that is different from the input. Distortion can occur at a single point or multiple points in a specific signal chain.

While there are many types of audio distortion, the most common one is clipping. It occurs when an audio signal is amplified beyond the maximum allowed unit in both analog and digital systems.

A signal is distorted when an output does not record the same signal as the input. The issue can occur due to amplifier clipping, faulty equipment, overloading of a sound source, production of hot signals, and pushing speakers beyond their limit.

In the past, people perceived distortion as a bad thing. Today, however, some kinds of distortions are considered beneficial because of their positive effect on the sound. Sound engineers apply plugins, outboard gear, and other techniques to add pleasing distortions to audios. The distortions work by adding unique elements to audios, thus improving sounds in many instances.

## The Difference Between Noise and Distortion

Noise and distortion can sound very similar and hard to tell apart. However, the two are different phenomena with unique characteristics. Noise is an undesired disturbance that sounds white or pink and creates an even-tempered sound wave. On the other hand, distortion is the alteration of a waveform, where some parts are amplified while others are attenuated, leading to an uneven distribution of energy among frequencies. Let's look at the differences between noise and distortion.

#### 1\. Where It Appears in a Signal

Noise appears randomly throughout the signal, while distortion seems at the same frequency. One example of noise is an audio hiss that can be heard when no other sounds are present. An example of distortion is a sine wave with a flat top and bottom combined with different amplitudes.

#### 2\. How It Affects Signals

Noise is random and can appear when signals are quiet. Distortion is affected by the input signal and can be altered by adding or removing signal frequencies.

#### How It's Measured

You can measure distortion by using an oscilloscope to display the input signal's waveform over time. The oscilloscope measures energy distribution among different frequencies, while you can measure noise with a spectrum analyzer by displaying an audio signal's magnitude and frequency content over time.

Despite their differences, noise and distortion are both unwanted sounds. When they are present in a signal, they can degrade its quality. For this reason, it is essential to understand the differences between them to assess signs and produce better results accurately.

The Gate filter allows users to control how fast and when the gate opens and what sort of sounds can get in.

* **Threshold:** This is the level of the decibel at which the gate opens. Set it based on the loudness of the audio distortion.
* **Attack:** This parameter defines how fast the gate will open. Essentially, the higher the attack value, the slower the gate opens. /li>
* **Knee:** With this parameter, you can control the response of the compressor to the signal that's crossing the threshold. That means you can apply compression with a delay or instantly.
* **Make-up gain:** This increases the signal level after it has been processed.
* **Ratio:** This value controls compression applied to the distortion. It defines how quieter the distortion will be after gating.
* **Reduction:** This parameter defines the level of signal reduction will be.
* **Release:** This value defines how fast the gate will close after opening. You can change the Release parameter to suit your preferences.

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

_You may also interest: [YouTube to WAV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) \>>_

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

_You may also like: [Best AIFF to MP3 Converters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

_Check this [MP3 editor and convert video to MP3](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) easily._

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

![ Filmora9 Export Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-export-settings-window.jpg)

The following table shows a list of formats and the details that Filmora supports:

| Video Format | Corresponding Audio Encoder | Audio Type                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------ |

| MOV          | Lossy Compressed            |                                |
| F4V          | Lossy Compressed            |                                |
| MKV          | MP3                         | Lossy Compressed               |
| TS           | MPEG-2 Audio                | Lossy Compressed               |
| 3GP          | Lossy Compressed            |                                |
| MPEG-2       | MPEG-2 Audio                | Lossy Compressed               |
| WEBM         | Vorbis                      | Lossy Compressed               |

Uncompressed audio is the original sound that has been recorded directly from the source in the analog form, and then converted to a digital signal without any modifications or compressions. Because an uncompressed sound is prepared with no retouching or manipulations, it gives an as-is listening experience. Since no compression is done on such a file either, it occupies a remarkably huge amount of space on your storage media.

Some sound files that fall under this category include:

#### 1) Pulse-Code Modulation (PCM)

 A PCM file is the digital version of an analog waveform that is created by recording the audio samples, technically known as pulses. The PCM format is mostly used when creating optical media discs, typically the CDs and DVDs.

#### 2) Waveform Audio File Format (WAV)

 Generally used on the Windows platform, this **audio format** is not a file itself but a container that may contain both compressed or uncompressed files. However, in most cases, it is the latter that a WAV file has, and PCM format is one of them.

#### 3) Audio Interchange File Format (AIFF)

AIFF is almost identical to WAV format in its characteristics with the only difference that, unlike the latter, it was developed by Apple somewhere in 1988, and works as a container for both compressed and uncompressed audio files. While the compressed version of the format is called AIFF-C, the term Apple Loop is used when the scenario is otherwise. As it is with WAV, even AIFF files mostly contain uncompressed audio, that usually is PCM.

#### 4) Data Stream Digital (DSD)

Used by Sony and Phillips, DSD is also not a format itself but a container that can store PCM files to provide decent sound quality. However, due to distortions in the composed audio, DSD files are not much in trend.

### 2. Lossless Compressed Audio Format

Lossless Compressed **audio format** is a type of file that is compressed using some advanced methods without compromising with the quality of the sound. This means that when played, you experience the same acoustic excellence as that of the source, i.e. uncompressed audio. However, even though the lossless compressed files are comparatively small in size, they still occupy decent amount of space on the hard drive or any other storage media in use.

Some formats that fall under the lossless compressed category include:

#### 1) Free Lossless Audio Code (FLAC)

At around half the size of the source sound file, FLAC offers the original audio quality without removing any acoustic information during compression. Being an opensource and royalty-free **audio format**, FLAC is even easier to get, and in most cases is used as an alternative to MP3.

_Check some of the [best FLAC editor programs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)\>>_

#### 2) Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC)

Introduced by Apple Inc. and initially released as a proprietary product, ALAC was made royalty-free and opensource in 2011\. Even though ALAC files are larger in size when compared to FLAC, the former format is used in iTunes and iOS as the latter isn’t supported by these platforms.

### 3. Lossy Compressed Audio Format

These are the highly compressed files that occupy significantly less amount of space on your storage media. However, during the compression process, some acoustic information is lost in order to reduce the file size. Nevertheless, if compressed correctly, the deterioration in the quality is almost negligible, and cannot be experienced unless the listener is quite experienced and the source recording is played next to the compressed audio simultaneously.

Some audio formats that fall under the lossy compressed category include:

#### 1) MPEG-1 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)

This is one of the most common file types and the **best audio format** for almost all media types that have sound. An MP3 file is free from the noises of the least significant in the composed audio. In addition, all the acoustic information with the frequency that normal human beings fail to catch (below 20Hz and above 20000Hz) is safely erased during compilation and compression. Furthermore, what makes MP3 the **best audio file format** is its ability to accommodate with almost all the devices of nearly any platform such as Android, Windows, iOS, Mac, etc.

#### 2) OGG

This one, again, is not in fact an **audio format** but is a container for audio that generally stores Vorbis files. Although OGG files are way advanced in terms of sound quality and even offer higher compression ratio when compared with MP3, they are not much in use as many platforms and devices don’t support the format till date.

#### 3) AU

AU is a format by Sun, DEC, and NeXT. It is yet another container that can hold both lossless and lossy files. AU files are mostly used in UNIX.

## Part 2: How to Choose Best Audio Format?

If you are a media creator, and are into the business of preparing audio and video content for your clients or directly for the audience, it is imperative to understand what could be the **best audio file format** to compose the audiovisual files. Here are a few tips that you must keep in mind in this context before proceeding:

* **Uncompressed Audio**

If the media type you are about to create is expected to be used for further editing before exporting to a different format, using an uncompressed audio format would be best as it offers a smooth and flawless post-production experience without giving much overhead to the processor.

* **Lossless Compressed Audio**

If your audiences own highly sophisticated audio players with Hi-Fi speaker systems, and they are also good at recognizing and understanding the differences between poor and optimal audio quality, using lossless compressed **audio format** would be a good choice as it gives decent sound quality in smaller file size.

* **Compressed Audio**

If you are preparing a media for home users and casual listeners, you can safely use an **audio format** that has been prepared using a higher compression ratio. In such a scenario, MP3 is the **best audio format** that not only offers the decent sound quality, it also occupies less amount of space on your storage media, thus enabling you to save more files at a given time.

## Part 3: Which Audio File Formats Does YouTube Support?

At the time of this writing, YouTube supports two types of formats namely MPEG-2 and MPEG-4\. Although both of these are video containers, they also hold audio files. Details about both these types are as follows:

* **MPEG-2**
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above
  * **Audio Codec:** Dolby AC-3 or MPEG Layer II
* **MPEG-4**
  * **Video Codec:**264
  * **Audio Bitrate:** 128kbps or above

Since many people nowadays produce videos in MP4 due to its wide range of supported devices and players and the fact that the container is used by majority of users worldwide, MPEG-4 with  audio format could be mostly seen on YouTube.

## Part 4: Audio Format in Filmora

Being one of the most versatile post-production tools preferred by many professional editors worldwide, Filmora comes with a variety of audio formats from all the three categories discussed above. Furthermore, Filmora also displays relevant information about each of the file types it offers.

## Part 1: 10 Most Common Audio Formats

Before listing the most common audio file formats, it is important to understand the categories of the sound files. Every **audio format** that exists belongs to one (or more) category depending on the way it is being created and the characteristics it has.

In a nutshell, there are three major categories, including:

* Uncompressed Audio Format
* Lossless Compressed Audio Format
* Lossy Compressed Audio Format

Below is a brief introduction of each of the classes listed above along with the audio file types that belong to them:

### 1. Uncompressed Audio Format
