## Part 3\. How to Slow Down Music on Mobile Phone?

Imagine you don’t have your laptop with you, now you can’t use any software to slow down music, neither can you use any online tool. What are you going to do in such a situation? Let us bring a cool solution to you.

You can slow down songs quickly from your mobile phone. ‘[Music Speed Changer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smp.musicspeed&hl=en&gl=US)’ is an application that you can download on your mobile and use to slow down your desired music. You can change the song's speed from 15% to 500% of the original speed. The application also offers an ‘Equalizer.’ Importantly, it supports a wide variety of audio file formats.

The application also has a built-in audio recorder. Music Speed Changer has a modern designed UI, but it is very easy to use. Let us help you a little by sharing its guideline with you.

Step 1: You can start by installing the application and opening it. After that, you have to locate and open the music file that you want to work with.
