Closing the window automatically exports your new track. This process usually does work; however, sometimes it is ineffective. The next step involves customizing the effects settings for the vocal remover.

The first thing you need to do is check the dialogue box on the right side. There is a 1 highlighting it. Two scales are available. No change should be made in these settings. It is imperative to consider the center channel settings and the side channel settings only. The Extract entry should be set to Center after this.

Several predefined ranges are available, but we will make additional adjustments so we will select custom. There will be 115 Hz at the beginning and 17000 Hz at the end of the custom frequency range. Sound waves below 115 Hz and above 17000 Hz are removed. The instrumental parts have been impacted if you play the audio. To obtain perfect vocals, you must make additional adjustments after the described attenuation method.

In this case, you will have to trim the end of the frequency range and refine some of the audio. On hovering your mouse above the figure, the mouse pointer becomes a double-sided arrow.

![adobe audition set frequency](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/how-to-remove-vocals-in-adobe-audition-unveiling-the-6-easy-steps-7.jpg)

## How to Use Audacity for Podcasts

Free audio recording & editing software audacity for podcasts is available for Windows, Linux, & macOS. Even though it's not expressly built for podcasts, it is a popular option for recording podcasts. If you don't mind a steep learning curve, you can easily record, edit, & export a high-quality podcast with this software.

## How to Record a Podcast using Audacity

Despite its complexity, audacity for podcasts doesn't need a detailed understanding of the software's internals to begin using it. As a beginner, we explain all of the initial settings and basic editing choices you'll need to know and how to output in a format that can be used for podcasting.

Here's how to get started recording your podcast using Audacity for Podcasts:

* By selecting the box to the left of your microphone, you may choose your audio host. Select MME for Windows and Core Audio for Mac OS X.

![record-podcast-using-audacity1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast-using-audacity1.png)

* Select the audio interface or microphone from the menu to the right of the microphone icon. In order to record your Audacity for Podcasts, Audacity utilizes the device that you pick from this menu.

![record-podcast-using-audacity2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast-using-audacity2.png)

* Select your headphones by checking the box to the right of a speaker symbol. To playback, the audio files, Audacity for Podcasts utilizes the device you specify from this option.

![record-podcast-using-audacity3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-podcast-using-audacity3.png)

## What you need to know about Audacity's Input Tester

Test your input before you begin recording your podcast. This helps you to make totally clear that everything is set up properly and that your podcast is recorded.

* The monitor meter may be found on the menu bar at the very top, at the very center. "Click to begin monitoring" is what it says.

![audacity-input-test1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-input-test1.png)

* Speak normally into the microphone you've placed on your computer.

![audacity-input-test2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-input-test2.png)

* Ensure that the Microphone Volume meter doesn't go over -12dB by adjusting the volume controls.

![audacity-input-test3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-input-test3.png)

## Audacity for Podcasts Recording Tutorial

Audacity recording is simple after you've set up all of the settings you need. Make sure to pick just one (Mono) Recording Channel while you're recording with a single microphone.

Each microphone is assigned a separate audio channel if you have numerous microphones connected to an audio interface or mixer. There must be a separate microphone and channel for each participant on your podcast so that you can edit them separately and make sure they all sound well together.

Each of these mono channels will be blended into stereo when you export your podcast later.

There is nothing complicated about the actual recording procedure.

* To begin recording your podcast, press the red Record button.
