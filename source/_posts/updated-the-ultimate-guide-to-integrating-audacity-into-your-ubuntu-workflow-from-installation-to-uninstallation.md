If you installed Audacity through the Snap method, execute the following command in your terminal: **$ sudo snap remove Audacity**

\>**Step** 2:

As of the right moment, the PPA has been withdrawn. What happens to the programs that are installed using these PPAs? Will they be eliminated as a consequence of the abolition of the Patriot Act? The answer is a resounding no.
