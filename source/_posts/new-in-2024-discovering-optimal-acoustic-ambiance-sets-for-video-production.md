## "Steps for Extracting Audio From an MP4 Clip"

While editing an MP4 (MPEG/MPG) clip, we may want to remove audio from the MP4 file completely instead of muting the audio and getting only the video stream as an output.

Sometimes we may want to remove audio from the original file and add a new sound tracker.

To help finish this task, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the right choice. With it, you can either delete all audio tracks completely from MP4 to get the video with no audio in it at all. Or remove an extra audio track and only keep the one you like.

#### 7. [Beatfind](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beat.light&hl=en)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Android

**User Rating:** 4.7

Have you ever heard a song you really like, but you had no way to find out its title or the name of the artist? The Beatfind app is just like [Shazam](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shazam/id284993459?mt=8) music recognition app, but with audio visualization options, as it enables you to discover new music just moments after you hear it for the first time. The music recognition mode that uses the ACR Cloud technology identifies the song if the app is active and near a speaker. The app’s music visualizer relies on your phone’s microphone to gather sound data and synchronize the visuals with the audio input. However, Beatfind doesn’t provide the tools that allow you to customize or record your music visualizations.

**User Rating:** 4.1

The iOS and Android versions of the ProjectM app have one major difference. The iOS version of the app contains a built-in media player, while the Android version doesn’t come with a media player. Nonetheless, both versions of the app offer powerful audio visualization features that enable you to create visuals from music in a wide variety of styles. ProjectM is probably one of the best music visualization apps for Android and iOS oprating systems as it contains hundreds of visual effects, multi-touch interactive visuals, and it provides Chromecast support. There are also several different modes available such as the Immersive Mode for KitKat devices or Live Wallpaper mode that creates animated wallpapers for your Smartphone.
