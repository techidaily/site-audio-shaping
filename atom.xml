I have a video, but I want to mute it before sharing it with my friends from my iPhone!”</em></p><p>As a friend of mine asked me this, I realized that so many people find it hard to <strong>separate audio from a video</strong> in <strong>iMovie</strong> on iPhone or iPad. Since iMovie is available for Mac and iOS devices, it can ideally be used to edit your videos on the go. The best part is that it features various inbuilt features that you can use to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;Mac. In this post, I will let you know how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on different devices.</p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-iPhone-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-iPhone-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?"></a>Part 1: How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad?</h2><p>If you own an iPhone or an iPad, then you might be familiar with iMovie, which is an inbuilt video editor app, developed by Apple. If the app is not installed on your iOS device, then you can get it for free from the App Store. While there are several editing features in iMovie, it offers a dedicated option to control the audio level or remove it entirely from the video.</p><p>To learn how to remove sound from a video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad, you can follow these simple instructions:</p><p><strong>Step 1: Load the video to mute on your iMovie app</strong></p><p>At first, just get the iMovie app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad and launch it. Once the iMovie app is launched, just tap on the “+” icon and choose to work on a new Movie project.</p><p>This will let you browse the available folders on your iPhone or iPad so that you can select the video to edit. Once you find the file, just select it, and load it on the iMovie interface by tapping on the “Create Movie” button.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone&#x2F;iPad</strong></p><p>After when the video is loaded, you can check its icon on the timeline and view its preview at the top. Now, just tap on the video icon from the timeline to get various options at the bottom.</p><p>From all the available options at the bottom panel, just tap on the sound icon. You can now scroll the bar left or right to adjust the level of audio in the video. Besides that, you can also tap on the sound icon from the side to remove audio from the video in iMovie on iPhone or iPad.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save changes and export the edited video</strong></p><p>Once you have muted the sound in the video, just tap on the “Done” button to save the changes. After working on the project, you can tap on the share icon from the bottom and simply save the modified video on your iPad&#x2F;iPhone.</p><h3 id="Pro-Tip-How-to-Mute-Background-Noise-in-iMovie"><a href="#Pro-Tip-How-to-Mute-Background-Noise-in-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="Pro Tip: How to Mute Background Noise in iMovie"></a>Pro Tip: How to Mute Background Noise in iMovie</h3><p>If you want, you can instantly use iMovie to remove audio from a part of the clip on your iOS device. To do this, just locate your video on the device and open it. Now, tap on the “Edit” button on the top to get different options. From here, you can tap on the sound icon from the top to mute the audio component in the video.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Remove-Audio-from-a-Video-in-iMovie-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on Mac?"></a>Part 2. How to Remove Audio from a Video in iMovie on Mac?</h2><p>Just like the iOS app, you can also learn how to remove audio from a video clip in iMovie on Mac as well. Although, the Mac app of iMovie also offers several other editing features that would come in handy to you. To learn how do you remove audio from a video in iMovie on your Mac, you can follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Import the Video you want to edit on iMovie</strong></p><p>To begin with, just launch the iMovie application on your Mac and choose to work on a new project. Afterward, you can drag-and-drop the video to iMovie or click on the Import button to browse and load the file here.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Remove audio from the video in iMovie on Mac</strong></p><p>After the video has been added, you can view its thumbnail from the files section. At first, just drag the video and drop it to the timeline at the bottom so that you can make the needed edits.</p><p>Once the video is loaded, you can just right-click the video thumbnail from the timeline. Now, from the provided context menu, you can simply choose to detach audio from the file.</p><p>This will display the audio component of the file just below the video. To separate audio from the video in iMovie, you can right-click the audio component, and choose to delete it. You can further alter the audio component from here if you want to.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Save the Edited Video (with the Deleted Audio)</strong></p><p>That’s it! After making all the desired changes, you can go to the iMovie Menu &gt; File &gt; Share and simply choose to save the “File” of the project on your Mac.</p><p>I’m sure that after reading this post, you would be able to remove audio from a video in iMovie on iPhone, iPad, or Mac. As you can see, both the Mac and iOS iMovie app lets us mute audio on any video. Though, if you are looking for more features and want to edit the sound in your videos, then you can give Wondershare Filmora a try. The application has a dedicated audio mixer and even lets us add voiceovers to videos. There are several other audio and video editing features in Wondershare Filmora that you would love to explore!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-top-10-audio-reversal-tools-latest-edition-for-pcs-and-mobile-devices-for-2024/"><u>New Top 10 Audio Reversal Tools Latest Edition for PCs & Mobile Devices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-pinnacle-of-live-audio-adaptation-top-tools/"><u>New 2024 Approved The Pinnacle of Live Audio Adaptation - Top Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/harmony-hub-unveiling-the-premier-linux-auditory-editors-comparative-study-of-free-and-paid-choices-for-2024/"><u>Harmony Hub Unveiling the Premier Linux Auditory Editors - Comparative Study of Free & Paid Choices for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-elite-sound-and-vision-mixer-compendium/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Elite Sound & Vision Mixer Compendium</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-basic-vocal-transformation-techniques-summary-of-features-and-alternative-solutions/"><u>Updated Basic Vocal Transformation Techniques Summary of Features and Alternative Solutions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-clear-sound-solution-eradicating-noise-from-video-playback-across-devices-and-browsers/"><u>2024 Approved The Clear Sound Solution Eradicating Noise From Video Playback Across Devices and Browsers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-audiophiles-advice-eliminating-sounds-from-iphone-visual-captures/"><u>In 2024, Audiophiles Advice Eliminating Sounds From iPhone Visual Captures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/audio-dynamics-in-motion-blending-auditory-data-with-kinetic-graphics-in-adobe-premiere-pros-environment-for-2024/"><u>Audio Dynamics in Motion Blending Auditory Data with Kinetic Graphics in Adobe Premiere Pros Environment for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-repair-a-damaged-video-file-of-galaxy-f34-5g-using-video-repair-utility-on-mac-by-stellar-video-repair-mobile-video-repair/"><u>How to Repair a Damaged video file of Galaxy F34 5G using Video Repair Utility on Mac?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-files.techidaily.com/simplified-guide-fb-video-to-mp3-audio-transformations/"><u>Simplified Guide  FB Video to MP3 Audio Transformations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-navigating-instagram-hashtags-maximizing-post-exposure-and-engagement-for-2024/"><u>[New] Navigating Instagram Hashtags  Maximizing Post Exposure & Engagement for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-lock-apps-on-infinix-gt-10-pro-to-protect-your-individual-information-by-drfone-android/"><u>How to Lock Apps on Infinix GT 10 Pro to Protect Your Individual Information</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/new-a-brief-guide-to-kickstarting-conversations-on-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[New] A Brief Guide to Kickstarting Conversations on Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fix-guide.techidaily.com/how-to-change-gps-location-on-tecno-spark-20c-easily-and-safely-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Change GPS Location on Tecno Spark 20C Easily & Safely | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-top-tech-reviews-with-a-focus-on-alternatives/"><u>[Updated] Top Tech Reviews with a Focus on Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ultimate-screen-recorder-features-for-pcmac/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ultimate Screen Recorder Features for PC/Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-premier-4k-recorder-apps-reviewed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Premier 4K Recorder Apps Reviewed</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

Since most of the anime series are in Japanese, they are dubbed in different languages for their global audience. Though, anime dubbing is an art in itself as it takes a lot of effort to provide a seamless entertainment experience to others. In this post, I’m going to make you familiar with the process that goes behind <strong>anime dubbing</strong> and how you can master it in no time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-about-anime-dubbing.jpg"                      alt="All about Anime Dubbing"                ></p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What is the Art of Anime Dubbing?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Why is Voicing Important in an Anime?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Is Anime Dubbing Enjoyable or Painful?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: Anime Dubbing Tips for Beginners</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-is-the-Art-of-Anime-Dubbing"><a href="#What-is-the-Art-of-Anime-Dubbing" class="headerlink" title="What is the Art of Anime Dubbing?"></a>What is the Art of Anime Dubbing?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/art-of-anime-dubbing.jpg"                      alt="Art of Anime Dubbing"                ></p><p><em><a class="link"   href="http://animeyourway.blogspot.com/" >http://animeyourway.blogspot.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></em></p><p>There are tons of anime out there, but most of them are originally made in Japanese. To make them appealing to an international audience, the concepts of dubbing and subbing are implemented. In subbing, we simply add subtitles to the scene by placing its strip at the bottom, which is comparatively easier.</p><p>On the other hand, Anime dubbing is a more complex process in which the original soundtrack in Japanese is first removed from the video. Now, a script is designed for the other language (like English) in which the video has to be dubbed. Afterward, voiceover artists would match the dialogues with the original pace of the video to attain flawless dubbing results. Now, the audience of the second language can also watch the anime with the dubbed soundtrack instead of the Japanese.</p><p>In some cases, even after dubbing, subtitles are also added in post-production to get better results.</p><h2 id="Why-is-Voicing-Important-in-an-Anime"><a href="#Why-is-Voicing-Important-in-an-Anime" class="headerlink" title="Why is Voicing Important in an Anime?"></a>Why is Voicing Important in an Anime?</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/voice-in-anime.jpg"                      alt="Voice in Anime"                ></p><p>Anime is an art-form and hence, it is should be treated creatively when transitioning into different cultures. The first generation of anime traces to the 1910s in Japan while they became mainstream with Astro Boy that was a hit not only in Japan but in the US as well. Needless to say, the anime industry has grown drastically with over $17 billion worth worldwide.</p><p>That’s why it has become more important than ever to focus on anime dubbing and make the content appealing to a vast audience. Too many times, while dubbing, the original nature of a character is lost due to the improper voice transition. Sometimes, there are edits in the script to match the pace of the scene that ends up changing the meaning drastically.</p><p>Therefore, to make sure the true essence of the anime is maintained, the concept of voice interpretation is implemented. In this, voiceover artists are taught about their characters and their nature. Instead of bringing their own flair while recording, they are encouraged to voice their characters instead.</p><h2 id="What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing"><a href="#What-is-the-Process-of-Anime-Dubbing" class="headerlink" title="What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?"></a>What is the Process of Anime Dubbing?</h2><p>Now when you know the importance of anime dubbing, let’s get to know about the process in detail. Although the overall process can be implemented differently in various countries and studios, the following steps are mostly followed by professionals.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Transitioning and Translation</strong></p><p>This is the foundation of anime dubbing as it helps us in scriptwriting and voiceover. Firstly, the anime is studied by the team, which includes native Japanese experts. For instance, if the anime is about Japanese history or its pop culture, then an expert from the related field is asked to join.</p><p>Furthermore, all the dialogues are transcribed and further translated by professionals. To make sure that no cultural norms are lost in the process, a group of people is invited to work on this. If the anime is about pop culture, then it can be a bit tough since some dialogues might lose the original meaning in the translation.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Scripting and Adaptation</strong></p><p>A mere translation of the anime is not enough as it is needed to fit the scene and should have a flawless transition. For this, scriptwriters take the translated document (for instance, Japanese to English translated version) and start developing a script for that. They will watch the scene simultaneously and would work with voiceover artists as well. In this way, we can avoid any delay or rapid movement between the picture and voiceover audio.</p><ul><li>The new dialogues should be spoken in the same way so that the original speech and the voiceover should be matched.</li><li>A lot of sentences have to be reconstructed entirely since Japanese grammar is pretty different than English. Sometimes, a single word in Japanese might mean a whole sentence in English. This means we need to write the script while matching the pace of the scene and keeping the meaning intact (which can be pretty challenging).</li><li>Scriptwriters need to focus on the way a sentence is delivered and conveyed. If you are not careful, then you will lose out on certain nuances.</li><li>To get an ideal script, you might need to watch the anime and deliver your dialogues back-and-forth. Writers are encouraged to be more adaptive and keep the cultural knowledge of their audience in mind as well.</li><li>If the anime is deeply rooted in Japanese cultural norms that you know your audience won’t understand, then you can abandon it while still being faithful to the original material. For instance, Shin-chan had too many Japanese norms and thus it was re-written in English to include more local terms.</li></ul><p> <strong>Step 3: Recording and Finishing</strong></p><p>After completing the scriptwriting, recording artists work on it to give it a final touch. Although it is recommended for all recording artists to do their voice work together for a seamless amalgamation, sometimes they record their dialogues separately as well.</p><p>The recording artists are encouraged to do their bit of research and are made familiar with the anime. During the recording process, artists focus on the “matching flap” movement, which means their dialogues should match with the movement of their character’s lips. For this, they can fasten or slow their speed of dialogue delivery or add bits and pieces in between to give it a personal character.</p><p>While it is not possible to be entirely accurate and match the pace, artists try their best by looking at the video while delivering their dialogues. Some mistakes and flubs are bound to happen in the process, but that is what makes anime dubbing so hilarious and creative.</p><h2 id="Is-Anime-Dubbing-Enjoyable-or-Painful"><a href="#Is-Anime-Dubbing-Enjoyable-or-Painful" class="headerlink" title="Is Anime Dubbing Enjoyable or Painful?"></a>Is Anime Dubbing Enjoyable or Painful?</h2><p>This is something that a lot of anime fans would like to ask voiceover professionals. Well, it would be subjective and depend on the anime as well as the professionals working on it.</p><p>In most of the cases, the process is pretty enjoyable if the artists and writers are fans of anime. Yes, the process can be a bit tedious, but that is the demand of this challenging profession altogether.</p><p>Michael Lindsay, who was widely appreciated for his work in the Marmalade Boy, admits how tough the job can be. It requires a lot of rework and the voiceover artists need to go back-and-forth to get the right pace.</p><p>Olivia Venegas, who has been a part of the anime dubbing industry for over a decade, admits how the process has changed. Now, production houses are more focused on creating a “localized” version of the anime that their audience can understand instead of keeping it rigid to their original material.</p><p>Overall, the change in the anime dubbing process and the presence of better technology has certainly made it more fun and less painful.</p><h2 id="Anime-Dubbing-Tips-for-Beginners"><a href="#Anime-Dubbing-Tips-for-Beginners" class="headerlink" title="Anime Dubbing Tips for Beginners"></a>Anime Dubbing Tips for Beginners</h2><p>If you are just starting your career in anime dubbing and would like to improve your work, then consider these expert tips.</p><ul><li>To start with, do your bit of research and make sure you understand the Japanese culture. If the anime is about history or a cultural phenomenon, then get to know about it so that you won’t miss any nuance.</li><li>If you are a voiceover artist, then sit with the scriptwriter during the translation and writing process. This will help you understand their writing process and you can also give suggestions regarding voiceover.</li><li>Focus on your speech and the pace while recording every word. At times, we are needed to eat some words or have to stretch them to match with the movement of the character’s lips.</li><li>Try not to be overdramatic and don’t “act” too much while recording. Consider anime characters as real humans with organic feelings. If you over-do it, then it can become funny and take away the gravity of the scene.</li><li>Apart from your usual research, also watch the body language of your characters and their expressions. You can try to take the same posture and position while delivering any dialogue for a better anime dubbing experience.</li><li>Most importantly, let the transition be more organic and feel free to make some creative choices to own the character. Remember, your aim is to be the character and not let the character become you.</li><li>Lastly, keep in mind your audience while dubbing and make sure that they should relate to the nuances and cultural slangs you have included. While it is suggested to stick to the source material, you can bend it keeping the mindset of your target audience.</li></ul><hr><p>That’s a wrap, everyone! I’m sure that after reading this guide, you would be able to know more about anime dubbing and the effort that goes behind it. Although it is a complicated and tiresome process, some new-age tools and applications have made it better. If you are also just starting, then make sure you follow the above-listed tips and be familiar with the available tools. This will help you become a pro and you can certainly level-up your skills with time.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-top-ranked-windows-edition-for-silentizing-videography/"><u>New In 2024, Top-Ranked Windows Edition for Silentizing Videography</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/2024-approved-mastering-desktop-and-mobile-unmuting-zoom-audio-with-ease/"><u>2024 Approved Mastering Desktop & Mobile Unmuting Zoom Audio with Ease</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-budget-transcription-toolkit-discovering-three-accessible-free-ways-to-convert-audios-into-texts/"><u>Updated The Ultimate Budget Transcription Toolkit - Discovering Three Accessible, Free Ways to Convert Audios Into Texts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-perfecting-soft-audio-edges-a-guide-to-smooth-transitioning-in-imovie/"><u>In 2024, Perfecting Soft Audio Edges A Guide to Smooth Transitioning in iMovie</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-rhythms-and-riffs-creating-compelling-beats-for-cinematic-experiences/"><u>New In 2024, Rhythms and Riffs Creating Compelling Beats for Cinematic Experiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-the-definitive-guide-to-chromebook-compatible-daws-ranked-top-8-for-professional-sound-engineers/"><u>Updated 2024 Approved The Definitive Guide to Chromebook-Compatible DAWs Ranked Top 8 for Professional Sound Engineers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/in-2024-magix-samplitudes-standout-features-are-they-meriting-top-spot/"><u>In 2024, MAGIX Samplitudes Standout Features Are They Meriting Top Spot?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/harmonious-news-audio-compilation-volume-15-for-2024/"><u>Harmonious News Audio Compilation - Volume 15 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-how-to-record-audio-on-powerpoint-windows-and-mac/"><u>New In 2024, How to Record Audio on PowerPoint?

It’s therefore important to learn where to draw the lines when using background videos.</p><p>Here are the best five tips to help use free video backgrounds the right way.</p><ul><li><strong>Use short video of low bitrate</strong></li></ul><p>To avoid buffering of the video and affecting the speed of your website page negatively, consider using background videos that are 2MB or less. A three-second video is good enough to make a website homepage or video background stunning.</p><ul><li><strong>Use loopable video background</strong></li></ul><p>Setting your website background video to play in loops is one way of ensuring the video is short. The other preferred option is setting the video background to play continuously. This tends to work better as it does not affect the CPU functionality.</p><ul><li><strong>Use slow-motion videos</strong></li></ul><p>Fast-moving video backgrounds are destructive and in some cases reduce the content conversion rate. To avoid visitors sticking to the video background for long, reduce the movements.</p><ul><li><strong>Use compressed background videos</strong></li></ul><p>A compressed video has a low bitrate and therefore plays smoothly without affecting the page load speed. It’s good to compress the video to 720 pixels. Even though high pixel videos are of the best quality, avoid them completely.</p><ul><li><strong>Use an overlay</strong></li></ul><p>To hide poor quality videos or very bright background videos, use an overlay on top of the video. A semitransparent overlay makes the video more attractive, engaging and creates more interest to look at, as the details are not clearly visible.</p><h2 id="How-To-Create-a-Video-Background-Overlay"><a href="#How-To-Create-a-Video-Background-Overlay" class="headerlink" title="How To Create a Video Background Overlay?"></a>How To Create a Video Background Overlay?</h2><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Filmora Video editor</strong></a> from Wondershare is the most used software for editing green screen backgrounds, blurring videos and creating video overlays.

Fortunately, you don’t need professional audio editing software to arrange and merge multiple audio recordings into a single MP3 file, since the Internet offers a much simpler solution. In case you were looking for a quick way to mix together several MP3 files, you’ve come to the right place because in this article we are going to take you through some of the best online platforms that enable you to merge MP3 and other types of audio files for free.</p><h2 id="Top-Free-Online-MP3-Joiners-to-Merge-MP3-Files"><a href="#Top-Free-Online-MP3-Joiners-to-Merge-MP3-Files" class="headerlink" title="Top Free Online MP3 Joiners to Merge MP3 Files"></a>Top Free Online MP3 Joiners to Merge MP3 Files</h2><p> Besides the supported audio file formats, you must consider the upload methods, the number of files a platform lets you merge or file size limitations during the process of selecting an online MP3 Joiner. So here are some of the best online MP3 joiners you can find on the World Wide Web.</p><h4 id="1-Audio-Joiner"><a href="#1-Audio-Joiner" class="headerlink" title="1. Audio Joiner"></a>1. Audio Joiner</h4><p> This audio editing tool is a part of the collection of video and sound editing tools offered by the 123Apps platform. Audio Joiner enables you to merge as many audio tracks as you want, and it supports more than 300 audio file formats. In addition, you can choose which parts of the files you want to include in the final mix, apply the crossfade effect that makes the transitions between two audio clips smoother or select the output format of the audio file you’re creating. When done, you simply have to click on the Join button and decide if you want to save the new audio file to your computer, Dropbox or Google Drive.</p><h4 id="2-MergeAudio"><a href="#2-MergeAudio" class="headerlink" title="2. MergeAudio"></a>2. MergeAudio</h4><p> This platform supports nearly all popular audio file formats, which means that you can use it to combine and create audio files in virtually any format you want. The MergeAudio platform doesn’t limit the number of files you can upload to it and the process of combining these files is remarkably simple. After you upload the audio files stored on your computer or online, you just have to select the output format, enable the Crossfade option and insert the name of the audio file you’re creating. Hit the Merge button to complete the process, but keep in mind that the amount of time the MergeAudio platform is going to need to create a new audio file depends on the number of files you want to merge. Click on the Play button to listen to the new audio file the platform has produced before opting for one of the available download options.</p><h4 id="3-Online-File-Merger"><a href="#3-Online-File-Merger" class="headerlink" title="3. Online File Merger"></a>3. Online File Merger</h4><p> Online File Merger lets you import files via URL or directly from your computer, but the platform doesn’t allow you to upload MP3 files that are larger than 50MB. In addition, the platform only supports the MP3 file format, and you can’t use it merge audio files that are saved in WAV, OGG or any other formats. The process of merging MP3 files is rather simple since you just have to arrange them, select the preferred Audio Quality, Audio Sampling Rate, and Audio Channels before clicking on the Merge button. Once the files are pieced together, you should click on the Download button to save the new MP3 file to your computer. However, you won’t be able to save your creations to online storage services like Dropbox or OneDrive.</p><h4 id="4-Bear-File-Converter"><a href="#4-Bear-File-Converter" class="headerlink" title="4. Bear File Converter"></a>4. Bear File Converter</h4><p> Bear File Converter enables to merge multiple MP3 files effortlessly. Just upload the files you’d like to merge by either pasting their URL to the URL box or by uploading them from your computer. The platform only lets you import MP3 files that don’t exceed the 50MB size limit, so once you’ve uploaded all the files you’d like to merge you should proceed to arrange them. Optionally, you can adjust the Audio Quality, Audio Sampling Rate, and Audio Channel settings before clicking on the Merge button. You can save all the audio files you generate to your computer, but bear in mind that the MP3 is the only output file format the Bear File Converter supports.</p><h4 id="5-AConvert"><a href="#5-AConvert" class="headerlink" title="5. AConvert"></a>5. AConvert</h4><p> The support for a wide range of audio file formats as well as a plethora of import methods makes AConvert platform one of the best audio file joiners today. However, the maximum size of the audio file you upload can’t be larger than 200MB, and you must upload the files in the same order in which you want them to appear in the output file because the platform doesn’t allow you to rearrange your audio files after you upload them. Each file you would like to merge must have the same bitrate and format and you must click on the Submit button each time you add a new MP3 file. AConvert platform lets you save your merged MP3 files to Dropbox, Google Drive, and you can also use the QR code if you want to save the new audio file to your phone.</p><h4 id="6-Inettools"><a href="#6-Inettools" class="headerlink" title="6. Inettools"></a>6. Inettools</h4><p> This is a simple but powerful MP3 joiner that enables you to merge audio files in just a few easy steps. Import the files you’d like to merge to the platform from your computer and wait for them to be uploaded. Hit the Make button after the upload is completed and wait for the Results box to appear on the screen. Click on the link in the Results box if you want to listen to a new audio file you’ve created before downloading it to a hard drive on your computer. Even though merging multiple MP3 files with this platform is a straightforward process, you won’t be able to control the quality of the audio file you’re producing.</p><h4 id="7-MP3Cutter"><a href="#7-MP3Cutter" class="headerlink" title="7. MP3Cutter"></a>7. MP3Cutter</h4><p> This platform is designed to help its users cut, convert and merge all types of audio files. The Audio Joiner tool lets you import audio files from online sources or from a computer so you can choose the method that is the most convenient for you. Once you’ve uploaded all the files you’d like to merge you can simply drag them in order to rearrange them, and then you can proceed to select the output format, apply the crossfade effect or rename the new audio file. Click on the Merge button to complete the process and then save the freshly created file to your computer. The only downside is that MP3Cutter doesn’t allow you to store the audio files you merged on Dropbox and other cloud storage services.</p><h4 id="8-Online-MP3-Cutter"><a href="#8-Online-MP3-Cutter" class="headerlink" title="8. Online MP3 Cutter"></a>8. Online MP3 Cutter</h4><p> Turning your favorite songs into ringtones or merging several audio files into a single MP3 file are just a few options presented by the Online MP3 Cutter tool. You can upload audio files directly from your computer, import them from YouTube or use their URL to add them to the Online MP3 Cutter. The platform also lets you record new audio files or copy, cut and crop the existing audio files. The fade in and fade out effects are also available so that you can gradually introduce a new song, while the Mute option helps you turn parts of the audio file you don’t want to include in the new audio file silent. Despite the fact that Online MP3 Cutter enables you to merge multiple audio files quickly you’re going to need at least a basic level of audio editing skills in order to use this tool efficiently.</p><h4 id="9-MP3Merge"><a href="#9-MP3Merge" class="headerlink" title="9. MP3Merge"></a>9. MP3Merge</h4><p> All you have to do to start merging your MP3 files is drag and drop them to a specified area of the screen. Each file you add to this tool will be displayed in the order in which you uploaded them, which is why it is important to import MP3 files in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output file. This online audio editing tool lets you specify the start and end times of each audio file you import so that you can merge only a selected portion of each audio file. Click on the Merge Now button when ready and specify the location on your hard drive where you want the new audio file to be saved</p><h4 id="10-AudioTrimmer"><a href="#10-AudioTrimmer" class="headerlink" title="10. AudioTrimmer"></a>10. AudioTrimmer</h4><p> This online audio editing tool enables you to remove unwanted parts of your MP3 files in just a few seconds. Simply upload the file you’d like to trim and specify the start and end points. Optionally, you can apply the fade in and fade out effects before cropping the file and saving it to your computer. AudioTrimmer can be a valuable asset if you need to clean up your audio files before merging them together or if you simply want to create a new ringtone for your phone. The platform supports nearly all audio file formats, but its output format selection is limited to just MP3 and M4r file formats.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p> Each of the online MP3 joiners we covered in this article is easy to use, so you don’t really have to be a sound editing professional in order to merge your MP3 files with them.
