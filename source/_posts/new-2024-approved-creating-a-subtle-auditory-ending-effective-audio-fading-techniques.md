* **Listen to Results Instantly**: With Filmora, you do not have to download your processed files to listen to the results. Simply preview and listen to the results in the editor to make sure you are getting the results that you want.
* **Remove Other Audio Elements from the Video**: The AI Vocal Remover allows you to remove vocals and other audio elements, including drums. You may also go further to remove any unwanted audio elements to enhance your video editing process.
* **Dub Videos with Minimal Efforts** – The feature allows you to completely remove the original recording and input your own fresh ones. This helps you create highly professional and clearly dubbed videos.
