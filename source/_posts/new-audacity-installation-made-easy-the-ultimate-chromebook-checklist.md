## "Audacity Installation Made Easy: The Ultimate Chromebook Checklist"

Audacity has emerged as one of the greatest free audio editing tools for Mac, Linux, & Windows operating systems. With a wide range of capabilities and quality attributes, it is a basic and straightforward audio editing application. While Audacity for Chromebook and Chrome OS isn’t supported, does it imply you won't be utilizing them in the future? Not at all.

A few simple steps are all that is needed to have Audacity for Chromebook installed on your Chromebook. First, let's have a look at some of the features this device has to offer.

**Features of Audacity for Chromebook**

Audacity offers a wide range of editing features right inside its user-friendly interface, and it won't hold back when it comes to personalization even if it costs nothing. Because it has built-in dithering and is superbly compatible with 32-bit/384kHz audio, it's difficult to ignore this really effective open-source utility. Importing & mixing audio files is a breeze using Audacity, allowing you to combine stereo, mono, and even multitrack recordings. However, it's worth noting that there are now just a few possibilities for the latter.

In addition, Audacity for Chromebook has low system requirements, to the point where it works even if your PC is able to power on. Using this editing program, you may mix and match multiple audio formats and sample rates to create a single, cohesive piece of work. In addition, when it comes to editing, you'll enjoy the unparalleled ease of cutting, copying, and pasting, trimming to the sample level, duplicating, and even adding bespoke fades with the discretely introduced envelope tool.

Audacity seems to have all of the essential impacts. Whether you're looking for preset EQ curves like those found on a telephone or an AM radio, or Bass and Treble improvements, this versatile program has you covered. With the Auto-Duck tool, you may add a voiceover and other essential features to a podcast, such as a compressor, limiter reverb, and phaser reverb. It's an excellent choice if you don't have a lot of extra requirements. Even if you don't use it often, Audacity will be the last piece of editing software you ever buy.

## Installing Audacity for Chromebook

Apps for Chromebooks are often downloaded through the Google Play Store approach. However, sinceAudacity for Chromebook does not support our low-power systems, we must go the other route. To put it another way, you'll have to use Linux to get Audacity.

Linux is pre-installed on most Chromebooks, however, it is still in Beta. Go to the Settings menu and choose Enable from the drop-down menu to use this feature. Please go here for further information on how to enable Linux on your Chromebook. If your device has this wonderful function, you may follow the instructions below to properly install Audacity for Chromebook.

* Open the Linux Terminal in the Launcher.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step1.png)

This is what you'll see when you click on the Terminal.

* To begin installing Audacity, enter the following command in the Terminal window that has already opened.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step2.png)

* If you've done everything correctly up to this point, you'll be able to enjoy the full benefits of the Linux operating system. What follows instead is a bewildering cacophony of bluster.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step3.png)

* It seems that Linux is questioning whether or not you wish to proceed. To respond, use the "y" key on your keyboard.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step4.png)

This screenshot shows how the installation process is progressing.

* Finally, you'll notice the green-colored text at the finish of the orders. Your program has been successfully installed, as shown by this message.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step5.png)

* It's only a matter of selecting Audacity from the Launcher.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-chromebook-step6.png)

## How to Uninstall Audacity

Just like installing it, Audacity can be uninstalled with a few clicks. For this, execute the command below in the Linux Terminal (and you can copy & paste it).

**sudo apt remove audacity**

When this is done on Linux, you'll be asked whether you want to proceed with the uninstalling procedure or not. If you hit "y" the same way as previously, Audacity will be removed from your Chromebook in a matter of seconds.

A screenshot of Audacity in operation is here.

![install-audacity-chromebook-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-audacity-via-ppa-step5.png)

While recording your podcast using the built-in microphone on your Chromebook is a great way to start, it's not the only way to fine-tune the final product. You must drag the track and sound to the center of the screen in order to begin the magic with this program. Once you've done this, you'll be offered a variety of alternatives to get the editing process started.

Using Audacity for multitrack recording & editing is doable, but it's best to use non-linear tools if primary focus is on that element. Apart from that, Audacity is widely regarded as one of the best audio editors on the market.

## Conclusion

Your Chromebook may be able to run a variety of audio recording applications. As with Audacity, you won't be limited in your ability to produce high-quality music with a wide range of unique effects. We also go through Filmora's voice effects & how users may use them to change and improve their voices. Filmora allows you to re-voice video/audio & previously recorded voiceovers. For video/audio & voiceover files, the Pitch option on the Timeline may be used. Change the tone of a video and recording to make it sound different. You can quickly alter the voices in the videos using Filmora. Your viral should be accompanied by a story or a video. Using the Changing Pitch option, you may change the pitch of your voice. You may modify the pace of the video to change your voice (Optional). Make a duplicate of the video or audio that has been altered.
